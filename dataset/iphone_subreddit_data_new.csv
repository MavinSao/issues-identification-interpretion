Is it worth buying an iPhone 16 in Europe?,"I'm from Italy, and wanna change from Android (OnePlus 10 pro) to Apple. Now, in mid August I like to wait until iphone 16.
Pro max exactly (I thiked from 1000 to 1500 for a phone that could live about 5-6 years, I prefer the big and best one)
But the thing is: if (I think) the 16 is thought on AI features but I'm in Europe (Italy) how is it worth to buy a phone that is ""nerfed"" here?
I should wait next year, hoping that AI features are implemented here? So waiting the 17 one?
I think my phone can do It for one more year, but I really dont know the ""best"" choice for this situation...
Any suggestions?

Iphone 16 : un peu d√©√ßu...,"Bonjour tout le monde !

Je suis sur iPhone depuis le 11 pro, que j'ai vraiment ador√© tout le temps o√π je l'ai eu. Mais apr√®s toutes ces ann√©es, il commen√ßait √† fatiguer etc donc, je me suis que passer sur l'iPhone 16 serait cool ! 

Eh bien... Je dois avouer que je regrette mon 11 pro. En fait mis √† part que oui c'est plus fluide, que j'ai dynamique island (dont je ne remarque que tr√®s rarement la pr√©sence) et de plus jolie photos, en sachant que je ne suis pas non plus photographe... Pour le reste, je reste vraiment sur ma fin. 

  
En gros, je suis vraiment en train de r√©fl√©chir pour renvoyer cet iPhone pour me prendre un Pixel 9 Pro et j'aimerais savoir si certains d'entre vous ont le m√™me ressentis que moi et si vous avez franchis le pas de quitter iOS.

16 Vs 16 pro overheating ,"Hi everyone, 

I'm about to buy a new phone from my OnePlus Nord, alike what people said I found the iphone 16 pro to be pretty perfect. I went yesterday in the app store to try it and

1. I like the camera and the new button it's very useful, but after couple of mins in the app the iPhone 16 pro was already getting hot while the pro max was colder (I was testing camera in both) 
2. Why they sell the 128gb? There is no meaning for that in a phone without SD slot. At that point the iPhone pro cost only 100$ more than the max.... (Which has a bigger screen, last long and seems a better cooling system) 


This two point make me reconsider the iPhone 16 pro max. Any advice between the 16 pro and pro max? 

I don't really want to much the bigger screen but it seems that the phone itself is less overheating and last longer and cost only 100$ more (comparin 256gb model) ",1727362800,iPhone16

Camera bug.,"Device Specs:

	‚Ä¢	Model: iPhone 16 Pro Max
	‚Ä¢	Launch Day Purchase

I‚Äôve been experiencing an issue where my iPhone crashes and the screen turns black for about 15 seconds. During this time, the battery indicator shows 1%, even though the battery wasn‚Äôt low before the crash. This only happens while I‚Äôm using the camera or trying to take a picture. Once the phone recovers after those 15 seconds, the battery percentage returns to normal, and the phone works fine again‚Äîuntil the next time I use the camera.

Rebooting the device offers a temporary solution, but the problem comes back after a while. It‚Äôs not limited to the default camera app, either; it also affects other apps that use the camera. I haven‚Äôt noticed this behavior with any other functionality outside of the camera-related features.

Has anyone else faced this issue or found a permanent fix? Any suggestions would be appreciated, as rebooting repeatedly is becoming inconvenient, especially when I need the camera",1727362800,iPhone16

Today I finally upgraded from the iPhone 14 Pro to the iPhone 16 and transferred everything over. I‚Äôm on iOS 18.

Consumer Behaviour Study: Do technogical factors play a role concerning Apple and Samsung smartphones?,"Hello

I am conducting a research for school to find out if peoples's decisions are genuienly influenced by the technological differences between Samsung and Apple, or if brand loyalty plays a bigger role.

For example:

Question for Apple users: Do technical qualities such as battery life, camera quality, performance, etc. or the Apple brand influence your choice more? Would you choose Apple even if its specifications weren't the finest just because it's Apple?

Question for Samsung users: Are you more willing to transfer brands if the technical specifications of another smartphone are better? Or do you continue to use Samsung in any case? Are you more flexible and prone to changing the phone you use depending on if another device has better tech?

Please do try and answer both questions as if they were one or give your general thoughts regarding the topic for a coherent analysis.

I'm rather interested in knowing what you think about if brand identity matters more to these phones than their technical specifications. Is the brand experience more important to you than the features the phone offers?

I'm intersted in learning what influences your decision! (Have already gotten lots of answers from Samsung. Apple users, I would appreciate if you would be able to help out)",1728226800,iPhone16

Advice iPhone 15 pro max vs iPhone 16 pro max ,"Hi all, 

I'm an Android user but I've used iPhones in the past. 
I wanted to switch to iPhone. 
I love the look and feel of the iPhone 16 (the colors, the size, the weight, etc...). 
However I don't think I can do with the 60hz screen. 
I mean... My Samsung Galaxy 21s that I've been using for more than 3 years has 120hz screen. 

I'm a bit concerned about the weight, thickness and size of the iPhone 16 pro. I'm not used to it. 
For that reason, I'm considering the iPhone 15 pro. 
It's 100‚Ç¨ cheaper. 
I love the iPhone 15 pro titanium blue color as well. 

Does it make sense? 
What are your thoughts?

Thanks! ",1728226800,iPhone16

It is from a brand called Nillkin. It is made of plastic. It feels sturdy by wonder how durable it is. It feels like the material is too rigid that it will break in a few months. The slider door clicks to lock at both ends to prevent accidental opening or closing. The buttons are a little tough to click as well. The black colour is dull though. It is priced at around 9$.

iphone 16 issues,"Hi,

I just got an iphone 16 and I am have some issues. 

1) after I type in my passcode to open my phone, the screen kind of lags when populating the apps on home screen. What causes this lag?

2) after using the phone for 10-15min. (not streaming any videos and not going on social media apps) of just texting, the back of my phone seems to heat up. 

My friend and I got our phones at the same time, both of our phones are iphone 16's. We both have the same issue. any advise/solution is appreciated.

Side Quest:

3) my old iphone 13, for some reason, has a duplicate/ghost contact and phone number: for example, the actual contact name is 'Team John Smith' phone number is 555-555-5555 (text is in blue because it is a iphone). i noticed that a duplicate contact is some how there, except it is named 'John Smith' phone number is 411-555-5555. the name is in green and the area code is 411. the other confusing issue with this is that the only way to retrieve this 'John Smith' contact is if i open my text message app and search 'John Smith,' both John Smith's contact will show: 'John Smith' (green text) and 'Team John Smith' (blue text). however, when i go into my contacts list, 'John Smith' doesn't exist only 'Team John Smith.' i dont have icloud storage as it is full, i dont have any other contact names that are the same, apple care has not seen this issue before. anyone have any advice? is this due to phishing? apple tech says it could just be a bug. i just want to make sure it's not a virus or hacking going on.

Deciding between iPhone 16 and 16 Pro,"Hey everyone!  Hope you're all having a nice day or night.  I currently have a base iPhone 15 so I realize it's really strange that I'm considering upgrading my phone and normally, I definitely wouldn't.  I'd normally wait at least three years, preferably at least five years because I wanna be grateful with what I have and use the phone for a long time.  However, my iPhone 15 has had several problems since I bought it, such as the GPS not working, Wi-Fi not connecting, and many other issues, that did solve once I took the phone to an Apple Store, but I've had so many crashes and bugs that I feel like I may have a lemon.  I also use a lot of the storage on my 256 GB phone so I thought upgrading to 512 GB would be helpful too.

I'm currently deciding between the base 16 and 16 Pro.  I'm leaning towards the base 16 because as much as I love ProMotion, the better ultrawide, the better telephoto, and 4K 120 hz capabilities on the Pro, I have 60 hz on my iPhone 15 right now and find it bearable.  I wish it was more than 60 hz for sure, but I find it hard to justify paying $200 more just for that alone.  Additionally, as someone who loves taking photos and videos, the 4K 120 hz video recording on the 16 Pro and the 5x telephoto seem really appealing.  However, I'm not a professional photographer or cinematographer at all, so I feel like these are just nice to have features and definitely not a must have, and it could be a waste of money to pay so much just for these features when this year is probably the closest the base and Pro iPhones have in features in a long time.

Lastly, I love the teal color on the base 16 and have noticed there aren't any cases for the 16 Pro that replicate that color so that's a nice bonus for the base 16 as well.  

I was curious if anyone here went with the base 16 instead of the 16 Pro despite concerns about the refresh size and battery and if so, what do you all think of your 16?  Thanks so much, and I appreciate you all reading

White or Black Iphone which one would be better to keep the inside of the phone even a bit more cool ? ,"I am gonna buy an Iphone and i thought of buying white because you know, low grade science class dictates that white color reflects light so i thought that would keep my phone cooler at Summer and/or hot temperatures. Then i thought ''wait but i will use it with a case so does it even matter'' ? And then i heard somewhere that black color supposedly radiates heat more in another words can cool faster supposedly ? Doe that mean a black phone can take more heat off from the inside of the phone and radiate it outside faster and thus keep the inside of the phone cooler ? Does that how it works or am i severely misunderstanding something ? Which color phone would overall be more useful to keep my phone least hot even if the difference is absolutely negligible ?

Battery life on 16 Plus,"How everyone is feeling about the battery life on 16-16 Plus? I have ethe 16 plus but feeling a bit frustrated about the battery. It‚Äôs my first plus iPhone, and I was expecting more battery",1729090800,iPhone16
iPhone 15 Pro to iPhone 16 base,"Hear me out, I know the vast majority will say ""This is a terrible idea"" etc but here is my reasoning. I have an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB currently. I came from a 13 mini originally due to it being the smallest device available at the time (It was stolen, unfortunately). My desire for potentially upgrading so early is due a few underlying issues on my 15 Pro - specifically the thermal issues I've been having and the terrible battery life (despite being at 100% BH). I am not a heavy user, I don't use any social media apps, only reddit on the browser, utilities, music and podcasts. I store everything locally on the device, no cloud at all. I'm nearing my 256GB of internal storage as it stands now. I usually only get a single day out of the phone with 3ish hrs of SOT being the cap, usually it's 1.5-2hrs. 

I'm debating trading my 15 Pro in for the 512GB standard 16, I understand I'll lose the ProMotion (I use an iPad mini so not the biggest issue), it's still the smallest iPhone currently available, apparently the Thermal issues have been rectified on the A18 and from what I've seen and read the standard 16 has amazing battery life. Camera is my least needed feature, I don't use it much. My carrier is giving me a wildly high trade in for the Pro if i decide to go forward.

To all those who own a standard 16, how has your battery life been? How have your thermals been? Is there any issues you've come across? I want to use this phone for 5-7 years.

Cheers.",1729090800,iPhone16
Is the (battery of the) iPhone (16) a baby?,"So I'm actually Team Android and decided to buy an iPhone 16 only for one reason and that's social media. That might sounds stupid, but as I mainly use my phone for Snapchat, Instagram &amp; Whatsapp, I want my camera to be as good as it is ""on the paper"". Which unfortunately isn't the case with Android devices (although the camera is basically great, no question). 
So I give up fast charging, a long battery life, 120 Hz display and buy a rather expensive phone just to read more and more about the charging processes. 
I'm hoping that the iPhone is a long-lasting and very reliable device and I'm also aware that the battery won't last 2 days. 
But is it ""normal"" to set the battery charging limit to 80-85% and not charge it overnight (yes, I know, over time the iPhone knows when to charge anyway) in order to save the battery. Or to buy a 5W charging adapter for slow charging?
For me, these are somehow ""new problems"" that I'm not familiar with from Android and I'm now rather insecure whether I won't be disappointed in the end if I'm only allowed to handle the phone with kid gloves. I hope you know what I mean.
Would you switch to Apple at all?
Besides that, I initially wanted the 15 Plus due to the battery capacity. But it's too big for me, the 16 costs the same, has almost the same battery life and I'm hoping that the AI features will be rolled out at some point in Austria.

TL;DR: is it really worth switching from Android to iOS for the social media camera? And accepting that the battery capacity is worse than with Android?",1729090800,iPhone16

11 vs 16 thought,"I have an 11 and it‚Äôs about time for me to upgrade (side note I love how iPhones last 5+ years. I don‚Äôt feel I NEED to upgrade now).

 I went to the Apple Store and decided teal is my color if I were to buy one. However the biggest thing holding me back from buying it is the ugly look of the camera. It is SOOO much uglier than my 11 camera. I totally get that cameras are getting better and more powerful so they need to stick out more but aesthetically it‚Äôs so obtrusive now. I love how my 11 camera doesn‚Äôt stick out too much and blends into the back of my phone. The new cameras have an off putting look when there‚Äôs no case (and I‚Äôm a no case person).

Should i get Iphone 15 pro max or Iphone 16 plus ?,"Now i know this question sounds stupid. Many people will just say ''of course pro max'' and they are probably right'' but it is the ''why'' part that i do not fully understand so people explain to me which phone and why ? To explain further perhaps it is because i never used a 120hz phone but i have no problem with 60hz and i have nothing to do with the camera performance. So at that point what makes 15 pro max better than 16 plus ?

What i look for in a phone is battery which 16 plus is seemingly either equal or slightly better (though perhaps 15 pro max can surpass it if used in 60 hz i am not sure), performance which A18 seems to be just slightly better than 17pro (please correct me if i am wrong) and mainly for me to be able to use the phone for years without much problem like it getting virus, significantly slowing down, breaking (i will use with a screen protector and case) and most importantly it having overheating issues. And speaking of overheating i have previously heard that 15 pro and pro max phones had overheating issues, my cousin also said his friend who had 15 pro also experienced it but now that it is gone with updates.

But if it this problem actually existed was it just a software issue or is the 15 pro phones perhaps not that good on thermals from the inside ? That makes me worry a little especially since the phone is made of titanium which also supposedly do not get rid of heat that easily. Was that the problem ? What i fear is the phone to overheat in the future again or for Apple to slow down its performance to make it not overheat which makes me a bit hesitant to go for 15 pro max.

What do you think ? Which phone should i get and please explain why ? And had Iphone 15 pro phones actually had heating issues and if they did are we sure if it was purely software or is something inside phone like thermals or it being titanium a reason and if it is can it overheat again in the future or can future updates cut its performance a bit to prevent the heat ?",1729090800,iPhone16

Switching from iPhone 8 plus to a 16... debating which 16. Help deciding?,"I have an iPhone 8 plus (my first smartphone, I've had it since late 2017) and am considering updating to one of the 16's. But, I am not sure which of the 16, 16 plus, 16 pro, and 16 pro max I would get, and holding onto my 8+ for another year is still on the table. I'd appreciate your thoughts and reasoning to help me come to a decision.

tl;dr - 1) Will pros get more OS updates? If not, why would better hardware give them more longevity? 2) Big vs regular size, battery, and the new regular screen is still larger than my 8 plus!?

Why am I switching? I'm of the philosophy of buying nicer things, buying less often, and using them longer, often to the point I sacrifice functionality for a while before finally updating \*glances at sad, once-really-nice windows 7 computer\*. I'd love to use my 8+ for longer, but it seems to be on the verge of becoming incompatible with the important things I use. For example, outlook says it needs iOS 17 but is still somehow working on 16.7.10. I don't know how much longer this will last.  As well, while my battery could last up to 1.5-2 days with my current usage it's mostly because I've gotten in the habit of avoiding my phone so it won't die. I'd like to use it for more than \~2-3 hrs/day of safari, outlook, mail, messages, and (surprisingly) camera. 

There are two main factors I'm considering in my choice for a new phone.

1) My highest priority is a phone that will last a long time. I'm hoping to get another 7 years out of the next one. This suggests pro is the way to go. However, given that phones are somewhat consumable, buying the absolute highest end one feels like a waste as if it's going to become outdated by OS updates at the same time as the regular ones. Unfortunately, I can't find any information on whether pros get an extra OS update from the regular ones. Does anyone have more information? Assuming the OS updates are the same, how much would hardware make a difference for longevity?

2) My other consideration is the size. This has two factors: battery life and physical size. 

2a) I'd like longer battery life and no matter what I pick I'm going to get that, but more is always nicer. From a youtube test video, it seems there's more difference in large vs small (rather than pro vs regular). And, in 7 years, maybe that tiny bit of extra battery will make a big difference in what I can do in a day without my phone dying, or maybe not. How did you decide?

2b) I'm currently used to the plus-size, I like the big screen, more room to see and type on. Although not the easiest to fit in a pocket (somehow I'm managing) or use with one hand. I noticed, with the massively reduced bezels even the regular 16's screen is hypothetically still bigger than mine.... so potentially I could keep my big screen and have a physically smaller phone?!? This seems too good to be true! Would switching from my old plus to the new regular be that big of a difference? Has anyone done a similar swap, or from big to regular?

What is the best battery charger for iPhone 16?,"I recently bought an iPhone 16, switching from an iPhone 11 where the battery was wearing out quickly and it annoyed me terribly. I changed the battery 11 months ago, and on Halloween there was 87% wear, which prompted me to make a trade-in. I used a lot of high-quality chargers: Ugreen, Baseus, Apple 5W USB-A, and USB-C 20W. But now I want to protect the battery from rapid wear as much as possible and imitate such users who have 100% battery life for a long time, from 6-9 months or more. (Now I follow the principle of 20-80 on iOS 18)  
I'm currently using an old Apple 20W USB-C A2305 US charger with an adapter for an EU outlet, and I'd like to buy an EU one for my new iPhone. I saw the 2024 version of MUVV3 for EU sockets. To make the iPhone 16 feel good in the coming months, should I take the original Apple 20W or maybe Belkin, Anker 20W? Is there a difference in technology that is best suited for the 16 series?

First phone purchase that was actually a downgrade,"I‚Äôve owned iPhones since they first came out and despite a lack of innovation, each new model I bought had a new operating system that performed slightly better than the last and made the purchase feel worthwhile.

This iPhone sucks. I regret this overpriced purchase so much. The first phone that actually makes me want to throw it at the wall. FUCK Apple.

All of my music has been screwed up. I lost any music I had on there that wasn‚Äôt purchased from Apple directly. All of my playlists have disappeared. Those playlists have so many memories. You might as well have deleted all my pictures. Had I known you were about to erase everything I would have at least saved what they were so I could just recreate. Fuck you.

They don‚Äôt offer you so much as a wall charger anymore because of ‚ÄútHE eNvIRonMEnT‚Äù, but somehow the environmental impact magically disappears if I pay them for it. 

The charger type being overhauled means all the cords I have laying around are all useless. Great for tHe eNvIRonMEnT!!!

iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus,"I own a Galaxy S22+ but as the battery has degraded, i have to charge it about 2-3 times a day also from few months I'm facing performance issues. I'm in the dilemma of choosing iPhone 16 or 16 Plus.

Things to notice:

1. I'm moreover thinking of getting smaller phone as it is easier to carry and use and I already have s22+ which I'm not going to sell anytime soon. But I'm unsure of the battery of regular iPhone 16. I keep my device to maximum 80% charge limit to maintain longevity of the phone and charge around 20% so how much could i expect to get SOT from 20-80% battery?
2. The iPhone 16 has really good battery as many of the users claim, but idk if the 60hz will be more noticeable on larger screen and also ill have two big phones but of course with advantage of bigger battery. iPhone 16 Plus will last an year more I believe too as the battery is bigger in capacity.

Help me decide which one to buy its hard earned money, I don't want to regret. Thanks a lot lads!",1730818800,iPhone16

What the actual fuck is that? I mean... It didn't even get the shape right like wtf...

The last photo was taken using video mode. It did get the shape right but unfortunately I can't zoom any further with it.

Upgrade thoughts from 12 mini?,"Looking at upgrading from my 12 mini as my battery is basically on the way out and I find I watch alot of streaming tv on my phone these days so want to go to a bigger screen finally!

So I am currently thinking either the plus / pro / pro max - though the price point on the pro max especially is giving me second thoughts (think it‚Äôs 900 / 1000 / 1200!

Any advice on which would be suitable? I was leaning towards the plus but wondering if its worth the extra on the pro modes considering Im hoping to keep it a while.",1731682800,iPhone16

I plan to pre-order the upcoming iPhone when it is released, and this year I want to use the Trade In program (which I have never used before).

So, when I pre-order an iPhone and want to use the Trade In program for this purchase, am I required to send the old device by mail using the kit provided by Apple (1)? Or can I have my old iPhone evaluated and exchanged on the day I pick up the pre-ordered phone (2)? I will be picking up the phone in an Apple Store.

In the first case (1), I know that I need to specify that I want to use the Trade In program at the time of pre-ordering, that is, online.

In the second case (2), do I need to specify that l want to use the Trade In program online at the time of pre-ordering, or can I do it on the day I pick up the phone?

I hope l have been clear. If you need further details, please let me know.

Is it worth upgrading from iPhone 14 pro?,"I currently have an iPhone 14 pro, 128 GB. 

I had it for about 2-3 years, and my problems with this phone are storage and battery problems. There are occasional glitches like randomly shutting down or freezing up, but I've learned to deal with it. The battery is not great though, and I have to always carry a battery pack with me everywhere, even though the battery health is only 83%.

I was interested in the iPhone 16 Pro Max, mostly because of the battery capacity, storage, and camera. Although, I do acknowledge that my current phone isn't very old, and many people can stick with it. At the same time, I don't want the trade-in worth of my phone to be worthless by the time I upgrade.

I am a college student so right now I am unemployed, but I do have FAFSA covering my tuition and I will have a FAFSA refund. I was thinking of using that refund money for the phone.

It's going to be a big upgrade regardless (11 Pro right now), but can't shake the feeling of being sold an unfinished product and that waiting for next year's release it the right choice.

Double Check Your Order,"So I cancelled my iPhone 16 Pro Max preorder. I watched a video today that gave me a new perspective and then checked my cart. 

My iPhone 15 Pro Max 512gb is paid off, and Apple offered $750 for a trade-in during preorder process but then it dropped it to $650 after I actually ordered.

The 16 is priced the same as last year at $1,399, but I‚Äôm struggling to see any huge differences that justify the upgrade or the 50% depreciation. 

Same camera, one new button. Maybe we have simply reached a limit to what we can physically do to a phone upgrade. Software and AI are the value now and that‚Äôs gonna be a bit delayed. I‚Äôm on the beta and don‚Äôt see signs of intelligence, yet.

Volume Control Sensitivity,"Just upgraded to a 16 Pro from a 12 Pro and have definitely noticed a significant improvement in speaker quality BUT have found the lack of more granular volume control at the quiet end incredibly frustrating. Has anyone else noticed this?

Going down the rabbit hole a bit further, using the volume control buttons, there appear to be 16 levels of volume. The problem is there is a significant gap between volume level zero and volume level one (that was not an issue with the 12 Pro).

If I‚Äôm doomscrolling at 2am and want to hear the audio, going from silent to level 1 is jarring enough to wake up my better half.

Yes, you can use your finger on the volume control to slide the volume, but even doing this doesn‚Äôt provide a greater range of volume control; despite the volume indicator level moving up and down pixel-by-pixel, it frustratingly still retains the 16 steps of volume.

Apple please either 1) recalibrate this, 2) give us the ability to define how many volume steps we want, and/or 3) make the volume slider properly gradient the volume rather than provide the illusion that we have more control than we actually do!",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

I need your advice on my iPhone 16 pro and heating issue.,"I bought my iPhone 16 pro yesterday and it is getting immediately too hot when I use the camera. It also gets warm when I use Internet and YouTube around 30 minutes or I use charger. I heard that there is no heating issue on 16 pro, so I'm worried.

I use iPhone for the first time so I don't know it's normal or not. Is there a problem on my phone?

Your advice would be really appreciated!",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

iPhone to Android Text Messages ,"Hello Everyone, 

Should you come across this post you‚Äôre more than likely experiencing an issue between texting someone with an android phone. In short, you send the android user a regular hello text, then suddenly they respond but as a group text. Your text messages are sending under an email as [phone number]@mmsatt.net. This is due to a slight glitch with (to my experience) AT&amp;T &amp; iPhone‚Äôs recent IOS 18 update. 

The fix is simple, you need to have the person you‚Äôre texting to delete the entire thread you both have created, do this on your end also. 

Then make sure imessages is only send and receive under your phone number &amp; voila, the issue will have resolved. Send a new message from a new thread and you will see that the text messages are being recieved normally again. This is what worked for me. Hopefully this helps!!

Cheers!",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

iPhone 16 Pro Max touch sensitivity issues ,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about similar issues for the last couple days now and I thought I‚Äôd post my experience. 

I pre-ordered iPhone 16 Pro Max and it arrived on release day Friday, September 20. Right from the box, the phone had clear sensitivity issues and wasn‚Äôt responding to every key swipe and touches, especially around the keyboard area. It was significant enough that you can clearly tell it from my 15 Pro Max.

Originally, I thought it was because the bigger size had perhaps changed the size of the keyboard and muscle memory had me missing the keys on accident, and then I thought maybe it was a faulty screen protector. Even after removing, and then later changing the screen protector, the problem persisted. I looked it up on Reddit and a lot of people were talking about this being an iOS issue and not an iPhone 16 pro hardware problem so I was hopeful that an iOS update would be the solution, but since Apple has not made any acknowledgment regarding this well-known issue, I was skeptical and wanted to double check to see and make sure that the unit I got was working as intended. I had a schedule with the local Apple Store to run some hardware, diagnostics and lo and behold‚Äî it turned out that the phone I had really was just defective ü´†

Luckily, Apple did me a solid and replaced my phone right there and then with a different unit entirely and so far, I haven‚Äôt had similar issues with this one yet so fingers crossed ü§ûüèº

But yeah, if you‚Äôre like me who had the touch sensitivity delay issues with your new 16 Pro or Pro Max model and wondering if it really is just an iOS bug, I would highly recommend double checking with your local Apple Store to make sure you don‚Äôt just have a defective unit like mine üòÖ",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

Honest opinion about iPhone 16 Pro Max,"‚ÄºÔ∏èAttention‚ÄºÔ∏è I want to say my honest opinion about the iPhone 16 Pro Max...

Like, come on, you don't have a laptop in your home or an iPad to watch videos on a bigger screen?
Better battery? There is no that big difference and charges everywhere, and also the iPhone 16 Pro is made from metal enclosed while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is still using black foil! Which makes the iPhone 16 Pro better in this and way better with heat and battery life.
For guys who like to be active, light, and flexible, this is going to be the worst phone for them, and the best for them is the iPhone 16 Pro! Even the iPhone 16 Pro looks more elite and luxurious than the iPhone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max!
I would advise any guy who likes flexibility to go with the iPhone 16 Pro and leave the 16 Pro Max for slow people!",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

Cases that don‚Äôt degrade signal or overheat the phone,"I‚Äôm curious whether there are cases that have decent heat dissipation without degrading signal. 

Yesterday while walking and playing Pokemon Go I was using a MagSafe battery and my phone paused charging. It wasn‚Äôt overly hot outside but direct sun on the phone can really heat the phone, especially while wireless charging. When I got back I took my phone out of the case and it started charging again, but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to go without a case while walking outside on a concrete path. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is a silicone case issue, I don‚Äôt feel they dissipate heat very well.

I have seen advertisements for a metal skeleton case that looks really nice and people say it helps keep the phone cooler than with normal cases. While the company claims it doesn‚Äôt affect signal, several reviewers have said they noticed as much as a 30% reduction. My neighborhood had poor cellular coverage (nobody wants a 5G tower in their backyard so the city has had trouble putting up new towers). I certainly don‚Äôt want my case to degrade an already weak signal.

Are there any good options out there? How well does leather work for that?",1726498800,iPhone16Pro

As a PC Gamer myself, I can see the difference between 60hz and 120hz.

Although I agree that 60hz is definitely usable, it is still a deal breaker for me when I have the option to go for a higher refresh rate.

iPhone 16 Pro vs Leica,"Hi all.  Putting it all out on the table here.

Yes, the iPhone‚Äôs camera has gone through renovation &amp; innovation since 2006.  And yes, lens and iOS technologies have been advanced in that time.

What is the Best Video and Camera Settings for iPhone 16 Pro Max?,"Hey everyone! I just got the iPhone 16 Pro Max and I‚Äôm loving the new camera, but I wanted to ask what video and photo settings you all have found to be the best for quality shots?

Whether it‚Äôs for everyday shooting, pro-level videos, or just cool features like Cinematic or Action Mode, I‚Äôd love to hear what you recommend to get the most out of the camera. Any tips for settings, shooting techniques, or hidden features would be awesome!


I asked chat gpt the same question and this is what it stated:

For your iPhone 16 Pro Max, here are some of the best camera settings to maximize photo and video quality:

Photo Settings:

	1.	ProRAW (48 MP):
	‚Ä¢	Go to Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Formats and enable Apple ProRAW. Set the resolution to 48 MP for the highest quality and more flexibility in editing.
	2.	Photographic Styles:
	‚Ä¢	Customize your look by selecting Photographic Styles in the Camera app. You can choose between options like Rich Contrast, Vibrant, or even create a custom one for more precise color tones.
	3.	Lens Options:
	‚Ä¢	The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers three lenses: ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto. Use Wide Angle (1x) for general shots, Ultra-Wide (0.5x) for landscapes or group photos, and Telephoto (up to 6x) for zoom shots without losing quality.
	4.	Night Mode:
	‚Ä¢	The iPhone automatically enables Night Mode in low-light situations. You can adjust the exposure time for clearer night shots by tapping the Night Mode icon and dragging the slider.
	5.	Portrait Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Use Portrait Mode with depth effect for stunning portraits. You can switch between 1x and 2x/3x to get different focal lengths depending on the look you want.
	6.	Macro Mode:
	‚Ä¢	The ultra-wide camera can take macro shots automatically when you get close to a subject. Make sure Auto Macro is turned on in Settings &gt; Camera to capture highly detailed close-ups.

Video Settings:

	1.	ProRes (4K or 1080p):
	‚Ä¢	For professional-grade video, go to Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Formats and enable ProRes video. Set it to 4K for the highest quality (note: 4K ProRes takes up more space).
	2.	Cinematic Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Cinematic Mode records at 4K HDR at 30 fps. It blurs the background (bokeh effect) while keeping your subject in focus, perfect for storytelling.
	3.	Action Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Turn on Action Mode for super-smooth video when shooting fast-moving subjects or handheld.
	4.	Frame Rate and Resolution:
	‚Ä¢	In Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Record Video, select 4K at 60 fps for ultra-smooth and high-definition videos, or adjust to 4K at 24 fps for a cinematic look.
	5.	Slow-Motion:
	‚Ä¢	Use Slo-Mo for dramatic effects. Choose 1080p at 240 fps for the smoothest slow-motion footage.

iPhone 16 Pro vs 14 Pro - Nightmode (Manufacturing defect) ,"I‚Äòve just came across a post from u/Akubruz where he tells about a widespread manufactory defect on some iPhone 16 Pro devices.

To check if your iPhone is affected by the problem, place the iPhone on a table in a dark room and take a photo with night mode and 30 seconds exposure. If you see some kind of blue lines/dust on the final picture, your device is most likely affected by a defect.

First picture shows the result form my 16 Pro Max, second picture from my 14 Pro. As you can see, my 16 Pro Max is affected.

There is a YouTube video (link in comments) in which someone explains it quite well. He says that the problem seems to affect the sensor and unfortunately will also show up in Astro shots.",1727362800,iPhone16Pro

Upgraded from iPhone13 regular to iPhone16 Pro. ,"Sharing in case anyone is thinking of moving up. Reason for upgrading - better camera and smoother interface. 

Other than that - really nothing different. A little faster. A little more responsive. A little brighter. Face ID is better. Most of these can be contributed to bumping up to a pro. 

The camera button is a bit gimmicky and I‚Äôve already pressed it by accident a handful of times. 

The action button - I feel most people will program this to silence their phone, as it was set before. It would be great if you could cycle through 2-3 functions by pressing the button multiple times. 

I prefer the squared edges of the 13. 

Conclusion: if your phone is paid off, I‚Äôd keep it and wait for something special from apple, or if it‚Äôs an inexpensive option, bump to the 13pro-15pro. I‚Äôm kicking myself for spending this much money on a phone that is only marginally better. 

I know Apple Intelligence is coming, but those updates as a whole will be released over the next year, and honestly I don‚Äôt care that much about it since I have Chat 4.0. My kids will get more out of Gemoji than I ever will, unless for some reason I need an emoji of a camel with sunglasses in a bathtub wearing a diaper drinking a blue smoothie.

Feedback for Camera Control in IP16,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some thoughts on the Camera Control button. 

1. Single Click to Open Camera Not Working as Expected
I have my iPhone settings configured to open the Camera app with one click on the Camera Control button. However, when my screen is off and I click the button once, all it does is wake up the screen ‚Äì the Camera app doesn‚Äôt actually open. It‚Äôs as if I need to click it again, and even then, it doesn‚Äôt always respond right away. Ideally, I‚Äôd love it if a single click opened the Camera instantly, without needing a second tap or interaction.

2. Soft Touch vs. Hard Press for Taking Photos
When the Camera app is open, a light touch on the button lets me access options like zoom, lenses, and other settings. While this is great for those who use these features, I rarely need it ‚Äì I just want to take a photo right away. But to snap a picture, I have to press the button harder, and that‚Äôs where things get tricky. The ‚Äúhard press‚Äù sometimes shifts my phone slightly, which can make my photos come out a bit blurred or off-center. I‚Äôd prefer if I could adjust the button sensitivity or remap the controls to avoid needing such a firm press just to take a photo.

Anyone else hoping for future updates that will resolve this?",1729090800,iPhone16Pro

Issue with Editable Photo Features After Google Photos Backup on iPhone 16 Pro,"Hello,



I am experiencing an issue with my iPhone 16 Pro regarding the editing features in photos after they are backed up and then restored from Google Photos. Specifically, I am unable to adjust the focus or change the photographic styles on photos after restoring them, even though these edits were available when the photos were initially taken and saved locally on my device.





**Here‚Äôs a detailed description of the issue:**



1. After taking a photo on my iPhone 16 Pro, I am able to adjust the focus, change photographic styles, and fine-tune other advanced editing options in the Photos app. These features, especially the ability to modify focus and styles, are essential to my photography workflow.
2. However, once the photos are backed up to Google Photos and then removed from my device, I lose the ability to modify focus and styles when I download them back from Google Photos. The restored photo is no longer editable in the same way as the original, and it seems like essential metadata related to focus and styles is not preserved in the backup process.



This issue limits the usability of Google Photos as a backup solution for iPhone users who rely on Apple‚Äôs advanced photo-editing features. I would like to know if there are any solutions or updates planned to address this compatibility issue. It would be beneficial if Apple could work with Google to retain this editable data during backup and restore.

I have seen similar reports from other iPhone 16 users and would appreciate any insights or solutions that Apple or the community could provide.

Thank you for your time and assistance.",1729090800,iPhone16Pro

Upset with action button and camera button functionality.,"16 Pro Max arrived today. Really upset with the limited functionality of the action button and the lagginess of the camera button. Seems like there‚Äôs a lot to improve, y‚Äôall think it‚Äôll be in IOS 18.1 or will apple be removing this new side button just like the MacBook touchbar?

My major gripe with the camera button is the fact that it takes a second for the camera to understand that you‚Äôre trying to take a video. When the shortcut is switched to instagram there is no way to record a video with the camera button.

Apple also missed big time by not allowing you to take control of a video with the screen after the button is pressed. Using the zoom function is impossible while recording a video with the camera button, and if you so much as slightly lose contact with the button while zooming on screen your video is trashed.

Also why the hell does the action button still have an option to be routed to the camera? Can‚Äôt have multiple functions on that button but it can be used for the same purpose as the other button on the phone.

It‚Äôll be tough for me because I usually change phones every now and then but my wife‚Äôs been using her 12 mini for 3 years straight and she has no complaints. And that inspired me to take this challenge. My wallet always has a hole because of my habit of buying phones so now it can rest too I guess. Hopefully will have enough self control to dodge the urge. Cheers!

"10 days with 16 pro, my first iPhone","Warning: Fairly long read

As the title suggests, I got my first iPhone (16 pro, 256 gb Natural Titanium) 10 days back, and its been amazing.
Got the Natural Titanium as I was fairly sure I didnt want the black or white, which seem pretty stock colors to me, and the desert seemed a little dull, off white version.
From the get go, the better chip, better RAM, and better refresh rate work together to make the phone feel so much more snappier and responsive and leagues above anything l've laid my hands on, including my ipad air. The Ul is super intuitive and feels really satisfying, and with Apple having introduced customisations with the Home Screen and lock screen, it's quite close to the flexibility Android provides. The action button is really handy, although I still use it as the slider it's replaced.
Battery life is actually pretty decent. The instant response while connecting to the ipad or airpods is so convenient, and it actually makes sense why people find the Apple Ecosystem good. Great photos, as l'd expected, but the 4k 120 fps, even in slow motion, feels literal magic to my eyes. The dynamic island is such a cool little interactive feature, cherry on top.
Essentially very impressed with the phone, as I hoped I'd be.

I haven't loved everything on this phone though. The camera control is gimmicky, the best use seems to be to launch the camera app, and to zoom in smoothly for a video. I didn't expect many Al features so their absence isn't really an issue, am excited for when they're launched for all markets though. The keyboard is particularly disappointing, as l'm used to having mixed language conversations on Whatsapp and Instagram, and my old phone had picked up those slangs and fed them into the diction ary by itself, which meant I could type those words by swiping with the Keyboard as well.
Here, I have to turn off auto correct and manually feed in a new word to the dictionary whenever i type one, and I'm not sure it gets saved for the next time (new apple user in that sense, help would be much appreciated). Additionally, there's a bug that really bothers me, which is that the keyboard tapping gets unnecessarily and inexplicably loud sometimes. Tried looking through Reddit to find a solution, couldnt get to one (help?).

Very satistied with the hardware and software, and the color though, plan to use it for at least 3-4 years. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
This is the Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear case, gives the phone a classy look imo. (The case isn't yellowing, just the lights lol.) Thanks for reading, best wishes with your devices :))",1729954800,iPhone16Pro

Getting iPhone 16 Pro when visiting NYC next week - would like to hear your opinion.," 

Trying to make up my mind, would really appreciate an opinion here ;)

Since Jan this year I'm using iPhone 15 Pro 128 GB with 100% battery health, however battery life itself is just meh (SOT approx. 4-5h hrs). It's usually enough to get me through a day without a charge, but still - I would just expect more from such a device, especially when I'm coming from 13 Pro, which was great in terms of battery life.

Now here's the topic - I'm from Poland, but I will be in NYC next week and I was just wondering whether I should:

a) trade-in my current 15 Pro and get the 16 Pro 256 GB instead. My 15 Pro is in perfect condition, so I assume I would get approx. 520$ from apple, leaving 580% to pay (excl. tax). This way I don't need to worry about selling my device back in Poland, I travel back with only one device, but on the other hand I don't get the full amount of money which I could get by just selling it on my own back home.

b) just get a 16 Pro 256 GB, as the price difference to PLN will result in getting this 16 Pro approx 250$ cheaper than in PL. The downside of this solution is that I would need to travel back to PL with 2 iPhones (one in the box) which may potentially result in need of paying customs...

c) stay with iPhone 15 Pro and just use power banks, waiting for an iOS upgrade, as the general jump from 15 Pro to 16 Pro is not that significant and hard to justify.

I know US iPhones don't have SIM tray, but I can get eSIM from t-mobile and it will work just fine. I also know that warranty, in case something happens, may not be applied in PL, however there should always be a way ;)

I still have a week to think about it, but what's your view on that? :)

iPhone 16 Pro Max - Pros/Cons after 40 days,"Today I‚Äôve had my first 40 days with my 16 Pro Max. I‚Äôm coming from the 14 Pro and am listing something like a pro and con list here.

**Pro/improvements/new:**

* Excellent battery life (over 10 hours SOT on one charge should be possible)

* Device doesn‚Äôt get as hot overall

* Display edge is super thin, which looks pretty good

* Camera takes good pictures as usual, the new photographic styles are cool

* USB-C

* Charging limit

* Action button

* Camera control (more gimmicky than useful)

* Theoretically AI-capable (in EU)

**Con/deteriorations:**

* Both WiFi and mobile reception are slightly worse (than on the 14 Pro)

* Touchscreen reacts poorly or not at all at the edge of the display. This means I have to tap further away from the edge for inputs to be registered. (Annoying when buttons are placed close to the edge)

* The large battery and large display are great, but the large iPhone unfortunately causes me pain every now and then if I hold it for too long

* The iPhone doesn‚Äôt get as warm when I use it, but it does get a bit warmer in my pocket than my 14 Pro

* iOS 18 definitely has room for improvement

* The glass back doesn‚Äôt sit perfectly in the titanium frame, which is why the edges feel unpleasant in some places (doesn‚Äôt bother me, but should be mentioned)

I haven‚Äôt listed the initial touch problems that were fixed with iOS 18.0.1, and the problem with the blue spots on certain photos.

Even if my list sounds rather neutral or balanced, I‚Äôm very happy with the 16 Pro Max! I was actually happy with the 14 Pro too, but unfortunately it always got very hot and the battery life deteriorated significantly.",1729954800,iPhone16Pro

Did you guys opt for 16 Pros or Pro Maxes,"Hey everybody, 
Hope you‚Äôre all well. I recently went from a 13 pro max to the 16 pro. I was motivated by wanting a more hand-able experience. I think I would get hand cramps in retrospect. Plus it was just generally heavy and weighed pockets and took up space. While I enjoyed the screen real estate and battery life, it was a cumbersome phone to use one handed too. Honestly, I adjusted to the smaller screen on the 16 pro pretty quickly. I‚Äôm happy with the size and quality. Plus, I have larger screens to use too(IPad. MacBook, etc.) And the battery according to comparisons is on par with my previous phone. The 16 Pro Max seems a bit enticing due to the extended battery life and the lighter weight due to titanium, but I‚Äôm still incredibly impressed with the Pro. Topped off the battery in the morning yesterday. And it‚Äôs sitting a little under 30% this morning. Plus, I‚Äôm loving the desert titanium. And I‚Äôm happy that I can hold my phone one handed and it fits into pretty much any pocket fully. And it doesn‚Äôt weigh down any of my shorts.

iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone 16 Pro,"**Some thoughts**

- The regular pro screen is already pretty big
- You get used to the ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù screen size fast, because it‚Äôs not that much of a difference anyway 
- I can finally reach the top buttons!
- The iPhone 16 Pro feels very light. My 12 PM felt like a brick and sometimes hurt my fingers when I had to stretch them to hold the phone.
- It no longer looks goofy when I have my phone in my pockets. You don‚Äôt notice it that much.

**Performance**

- Yeah, it‚Äôs way way faster. My 12PM was stuttering and lagging a lot as of lately
- The speaker quality is amazing, very impressed
- The voice quality when talking on the phone feels so loud and crisp. I could sometimes barely hear the other person on my 12PM",1731682800,iPhone16Pro
screen resolution is blurry?,"Hey everyone, so I just purchased the iPhone 16 Pro a few days ago and I immediately noticed that the screen resolution is even more blurrier than the previous phone I had. (iPhone 14 Pro) I have tried getting used to it but it bothers me so much.

Of course, this made me consider exchanging my phone but there‚Äôs no way I can guarantee getting a different display. Any tips? And is anyone else going through this? ",1731682800,iPhone16Pro

New setup,"Got the case on Aliexpress, the buttons jut out a little too much for my liking but no issues with functionality. Good match for natural titanium.

Been looking for a separate universal capacitive camera control button and finally found one. It pretty much rests on top of the button and is held in place by the case. It's not made for the case so the fit isn't perfect by any means, but it's super helpful for those cases with a cutout that makes it difficult to reach the button to swipe through camera options. It works just as well as the actually button. I can post a video if needed.

The magsafe ring stand I saw on Amazon but found it on Shein for cheaper. Looks real nice on natural Ti and has a lot of functionality. Serves as a ring holder, stand, elevates the phone above surfaces so you can charge while in portrait, good for propping phone up for facetime calls, has external magnets to mount it to metal surfaces, and it folds into itself so it sits pretty thin on the phone. Only con is the external magnet is VERY strong, and you usually have to remove it from the phone to get it off what it's attracted to.

Which phone is the best purchase in this scenario? ,"
I need a new phone and I intend to keep it for five years. I want longevity. Camera is important which makes 5x zoom on 16 Pro intriguing but is it really necessary?
Battery is of course important as well. Do the 16 Pro perform better in the long run here?

The phones I'm weighing and their current best prices in my market are:
15 Pro 512gb - 1290 USD
15 Pro 128gb - 1000 USD
16 Pro 256gb - 1460 USD  

Each of these have their own USP. Price, storage or camera. 

I can make up rationale for every choice. But I'm a cheap bastard and don't want to pay too much either. Calculating the monthly cost over five years makes the 16 Pro sound like a good option money wise.

How to clean USB C port + Issued with cable durability,"Grabbed a 15 Pro when they launched and have had mixed feelings about the USB C port so far. One big thing I'm noticing is that the port seems to get dirty WAY easier than the lightning ports have in the past and I have very frequent connection issues when using things like CarPlay. With my old phones I used to be able to get a small cotton swab from work in there with some ISO and she would come out squeaky clean and good for the next 6-12 months. Now it seems like every few weeks I gotta get in there and try to clean it out. Sometimes it almost sounds like there's a piece of sand or someting in there when I plug a cable in but when i visually check there's nothing obvious. There's not enough space to get any sort of tool in there so I've just been filling the port with ISO and then blowing it out with compressed air a few times. Is there a better way to get gunk out and actually clean up the contacts? 

Also I'm gunna sound like a broken record as this point but I've never gone through so many cables before. The coiled ones I was buying on amazon for my car were lasting maybe 2-3 weeks each and I bought a straight braided Belkin one that lasted all of 2 months before I got connection issues from the cable itself. I'm not abusing these cables or bending them like crazy or anything. Just plugging my phone in and dropping it in the cupholder about 3-4 times a day.

Anyone else intentionally use a non-magnetic case with magsafe?,"I got both the magnetic and non-magnetic versions of the Torras slim fit case. I prefer the non-magnetic. The phone still sticks to magsafe chargers, but I can remove it easily with one hand and put it back on \*quietly\*, both useful for nighttime use when not wanting to disturb my partner. With the magnetic version, I found myself picking up the charger along with the phone (mainly to avoid the loud snap when replacing it but also because it was hard to remove with one hand) which kind of defeats the purpose of wireless charging.

Maybe this could also be solved with a magsafe charger with a weaker magnet inside and a more cushiony surface? I'm using Belkin charging pad.",1704034800,iPhone

Before my iPhone 11 I had an S10+ android could program the Bixby key to skip to next track by double tapping through the use of a 3rd party app. Haven‚Äôt found a way to do this with the action button (I‚Äôm sure there probably is a way - but I like having it as the ringer - do wish there was a double tap trigger for the action button to add a secondary functionality). On my 11 I had to manually open the app or swipe down to switch tracks if my phone was unlocked/in use.

Request: Heavy-duty case for the normally-nude carrier,"I usually carry my iPhone ""nude"" i.e. without a case or without a screen protector. This has worked fine for me since iPhone 4.

I normally carry the phone in the front pocket of my jeans, with nothing else in there. But when I'm hiking or outside in the summer, I sometimes put it in the backpack or some other bag. This is when those pesky scratches creep in on the display.

I'm looking for a case that I can throw on just for these occasions. It can be as ugly as they come. Should be easy to find, but I want one with display protection, like a folio case.

Bluetooth audio stuttering,"Hey,

The audio is not stuttering when using the phone's speaker, so I strongly suspect it has to do something with bluetooth somehow.

How does 1st year limited warranty work,"Hi all, have a question about how the 1 year limited warranty is activated. Is it;

1. Warranty activates on purchase date
2. Warranty activates upon switching on the device/connect wifi/ setting it up with your Apple ID

I am asking because I purchased an iPhone 15 Pro Max that had the white tear seals with the green arrows intact, but upon opening up the box and starting up the phone, the warranty had already started for a few days.

I purchased from a grey dealer and he said it was from a telco company where warranty activates from the purchase date at the telco.

I did my own research and came across another sealed phone. However, keying in the serial into the Support App versus browser yields different results. Look at the two photos. If I key the s/n into the Support App, warranty is shown to expire in Dec 14 2024. In browser, it is shown as inactive.

I now find it even more confusing and feel like I‚Äôve been scammed into buying a phone that was switched on and registered before. If so the scammer had professional resealing done and I was none the wiser.

Appreciate any help here üôè",1704898800,iPhone
Do iPhones detect humidity or something?,"My iPhone 12 always reduces the volume of the speakers while I‚Äôm in the shower. No steam, just cold water.

plan for ex-pat,"Hey everyone

I have been wrestling with this and I am sure many people have asked the same thing so please forgive me. Here goes.

I have a US number that I have owned since... 2003 (!!). The idea of separating from it is impossible. My work, family, friends etc. are all on that line and it would be very inconvenient to change it.

However, I am spending 80% of my time abroad - in Mexico City.

For a while I was on Google Fi, which I thought was very good and not expensive - but then I got threatened with disconnection due to their roaming restrictions. I switched over to AT&amp;T because they allow you to spend unlimited time in Mexico without cutting your line.

However this comes at an exorbitant cost. My bills are sometimes $185/month. Yes, this gives me the freedom to keep the line and use the phone as though I were in the US. But it's obviously expensive- unless someone tells me it's par for the course for this kind of service.

Wondering if anyone out there has any good advice on how to set myself up so that

a) I keep my US number

b) I use it abroad as though I were in the US, making and receiving calls/sms's, data etc. without issue.

c) don't have to worry about roaming restrictions that could result in being disconnected.",1704898800,iPhone

Did Anyone Know the 14 Pro and 15 Pro Use The Same Camera?,"I was going through some Apple Events to take some screenshots of the camera improvements since the iPhone Compare tool isn't as in-depth as I'd like. I noticed that when looking closer at the iPhone 15 specs, the regular model uses a worse 48MP sensor than the 14 Pro... and that the 15 Pro specs were exactly the same!

I have a 14 Pro and I was considering getting the regular 15 (by trading in old phones) and giving away my 14 Pro since I'd still have a similar camera in a lighter body. Or, I was going to wait for the 16-series (new contract). But after realizing the camera sensor similarities, I guess I'm definitely waiting for the 16-series. Was this well-known?

"iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max? [Old debate I know, but read below]","I know there's a load of threads on this topic from the time of launch, but I really don't get what most people mean by their opinions on batt life? Can someone who ditched the 15 Pro for a Pro Max on that basis share context on usage v/s batt life?

In terms of size etc - both phones are going to be a massive adjustment for me because I've got a 13 mini - I specifically picked it for the size, but now I have a 15 Pro Max (256gb) on me and I'm debating whether if a 15 Pro (512gb) would be a better choice. But the comments are usually on how long the phones last. My usage is standard - Whatsapp (&amp; Whatsapp web)/ Instagram/ LinkedIn/ Spotify occasionally paired with airpods (max 2h a day based on my commute)/ Apple Watch all day/ frequent calls when I'm at work (short durations but frequent)/ work emails.

I'm not a photographer really so I'll probably use the 5x zoom.... twice LOL. I do take pictures, but more of people. Currently my phone lasts me the whole day with the same usage - charge by 8am and then it's on power saver mode by the night. I don't charge overnight so it's usually a once a day charge unless I use it a lot on calls. I do use my phones for years - I wouldn't have ditched the mini to be honest, it's only because I got the 15 Pro Max that I am changing phones, knowing well that I'll end up using it for 3-4 years at least. So yeah 15 Pro or Pro Max - and why?:) ",1705762800,iPhone

Record video to SD Card - iphone14pro,"Hi all,
Recently I purchased a 256gb 14pro for the main purpose of video recording. I figured I didn‚Äôt need the 15pro as the 14pro‚Äôs camera is pretty stellar and I could save a couple hundred bucks by buying a refurbished model. 

I saw a few clips of the 15pro recording to an SD card using a usb-c to SD card dongle and figured I could do the same with my 14pro with a lightning to usb-c adapter. 

I just found out the 15pro got a big upgrade to data transfer speeds of 10gigabits/s and the 14pro is stuck with the old 480mb/s. Is this a concerning factor for recording 4k video live to an SD card connected through 2 dongles? I will be using the Blackmagic Cam app. Thanks!

My First iPhone,"A little background, my last device was a S22 Ultra but I‚Äôve also owned Google Pixels along with Samsung‚Äôs entire ‚ÄúNote‚Äù line. The reason why I swapped was quite simple, I wanted to try something new. I always said I‚Äôd never get an iPhone unless it switched to USB C so I decided to be a woman of my word and make the switch. I was a little tempted by the S24 Ultra but seems like nothing much has changed and the 15 PM is cheaper so my decision was easy. Anyways here‚Äôs a pros and cons list for anyone looking to switch or just plain curious as to what I think. 

**Pros**: 

10 hours of SOT is insane, not stopping to charge my device throughout the day is appreciated. 

**Everything I need &amp; nothing else.** So far every feature of my iPhone is something I‚Äôve actually used or can see myself using. I feel like every year Android flagships launch with crazy specs and features that look great on paper but in reality they‚Äôre buggy/laggy or have no true usability. I appreciate that Apple isn‚Äôt cramming features in for the sake of it. 

**Face ID.** I thought I‚Äôd miss the built-in fingerprint scanner of the S22 Ultra but Face ID is a million times better. It‚Äôs faster, works without failure and has attention aware so no one can unlock my device in my sleep.  

**Dynamic Island** is beautiful, need I say more? 

**FaceTime &amp; iMessage.** They‚Äôre so much nicer and easier to use than any Android alternative‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm looking at you Google Duo/Meet.  

**No bloatware**.

**Back tap &amp; Action Button.**

**New phone every year.** No longer stuck with a significantly slower Android device after 1 yr and able to return my device whenever w/o having to pay it off for the latest model thanks to my carrier's upgrade program. 

**Haptics.** I noticed that the vibrations of iPhone seem‚Ä¶more controlled? They‚Äôre of varying strengths whereas on my Android devices it feels like a cheaper motor that only knows on and off.  

**Cons**: 

**Keyboard.** Does apple prefer preserving their aesthetic over real usability in terms of keyboard functionality? I want a top row of numbers and a clipboard where I can save things. Please Apple I beg. 

Every **browser** available is just reskinned Safari?  

**Siri** is lacking. Would love an option to properly replace her with Google assistant like on Android where Assistant, Bixby and Alexa can be swapped for one another.  I've seen someone use shortcuts to get around this. 

**Size.** Noticeably smaller than my S22 Ultra. I feel like I‚Äôm a minority here as I do prefer the bigger phones. This is a small con as the 15 PM is still a decent size. Maybe the 16 PM will launch with a better size.  

**Do not disturb** doesn‚Äôt function in the way I‚Äôm used to‚Ä¶ DND sends callers straight to voicemail rather than allowing them to call without making my device ring or vibrate in any way.  

**Inferior Notification Center and control center.** I much prefer swiping down from anywhere on the screen and having everything right there in the open. Why are notifications one big stack? It doesn‚Äôt make sense.  

**Gestures** I miss being able to swipe up from the bottom left of my S22 Ultra to go back. The upper left button is honestly awful design. Muscle memory is a bitch. 

**T9 dialing** Doesn‚Äôt seem to be a feature .

**Widgets** aren‚Äôt as good and can't place them as freely.  


**TLDR:** Overall I love my new iPhone 15 Pro Max and look forward to grabbing a pair of AirPods, Apple watch and possibly a MacBook or iPad in the near future. This really solidified my swap into the Apple Ecosystem. P.S. APPLE GIMME A BETTER KEYBOARD. ",1706626800,iPhone

Can I rinse my iPhone 15 Pro Max under water like I did with my XS Max?,"I've always been a bit meticulous about keeping my phones clean, and with my old iPhone XS Max, I had a pretty solid routine. Despite it being only water-resistant (2 meters for 30 minutes) and not waterproof, I'd frequently give it a quick wash under running water to spruce it up. I've done this countless times without any problem.

Not only did I rely on the water resistance, but I was also cautious enough to use a neat shortcut afterwards that made the speakers emit special sound waves to eject any trapped water, speeding up the drying process.

However, one day, after a usual water clean-up, my Face ID failed, presumably because of water intrusion. This incident has kind of spooked me, and since then, I've steered clear of using water around my iPhones.

Fast forward to today, I'm using the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and its water resistance is much better than the XS Max ‚Äî the best in the industry. They say ""6 meters for 30 minutes""! But even with dirt or smudges, I find myself hesitating and just using a dry cloth instead, which honestly doesn't do as good of a job as a water wash.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max also has a redesigned layout; the speaker isn't right in front of the Face ID module like it was on the XS Max. It's positioned above it, creating a bit of a barrier that, I assume, makes it less likely for water to sneak into the Face ID tech.

Given the improved water resistance and the design change, I'm really tempted to go back to my old ways and give this phone a proper wash under the tap. What do you guys think? Is it a safe bet to start rinsing my iPhone 15 Pro Max to get that fresh, clean look again?

Wifi speed issues with 13 mini,"I wanted to ask about issue my wife has with her iphone 13 mini. It just ran out of warranty (literally month ago).

Im very well versed in IT stuff (im award winning IT tech) and cant find any fault except on her iphone. Every device can get above 200mbps over wifi, but her iphone most of times gets 0.6-2mbps.

Mail App Inbox issue.,"Hello! 

I've recently been having an issue with the iOS mail app on my iPhone. 

Four years if I clicked on inbox I would see obviously everything in my inbox. 

As of yesterday when I look in my inbox I see two recent emails and then everything else behind it is from several years ago...  as if everything that arrived in my inbox the last few years just never happened. 

It's just not in the inbox anymore. 

I thought everything was lost for good but when I back out of the inbox and then click on the  ""all mail"" option I seem to see a majority of what was missing from the inbox. 

I've been using iPhones for a decade and I've never had this issue with my mail before. 

Any reason why my inbox is acting this way and any resolution for this issue? 

It's very frustrating and I'm worried emails and documents are not coming through properly anymore and I'm missing stuff because the inbox isn't being an inbox  lol.

Just a big iPhone or small iPhone + iPad?,"Hello,  
this year I would like to retire my ""old"" iPhone 12 (6.1"") and buy a new iPhone. I use the phone to do many things, including for office work, freelance work, managing my finances, taking pictures, etc. Often, when I take a moment on the couch, toilet, waiting room, I like to read some news, articles, watch videos etc. For this reason, I have been thinking of upgrading to a larger iPhone (a Plus or Max model) that would allow me to see various content better because of the larger screen. At the same time, however, I have two doubts:

* I would not want to carry around an exaggeratedly large device (I would get the iPhone 16s that are supposed to be even bigger this year). However, I generally don't use my phone so much on the fly during the days, I mainly use it while sitting in the office
* I wouldn't want to spend too much time on my phone-I'm trying to avoid consuming too much content (social, youtube, reddit, etc.). I am afraid that with a large device, I would be attached all day, because it will tempt me to watch content directly from the device thaat I always have with me at hand

Therefore, I thought of another possible solution: an iPhone Mini (13 mini for example) with the addition of an iPad (iPad Mini or an iPad Air). 

This way, when I am out I can have a small and compact iPhone. On the other hand, when I have some time to spend on some content, I would pick up an iPad (avoiding other apps that might distract me from the phone). 

What do you think? Any suggestions?

Severely disappointed with the iPhone 14 Pro.,"I am severely disappointed with the iPhone 14 Pro. I bought it around the time it launched. It was my first phone upgrade in years and I was super excited at how the ‚Äúcamera would rival a DSLR‚Äù. 

However. Pretty much since I purchased it I‚Äôve had problems with it. The camera buzzed when I zoomed in. It stopped focusing properly (I assume as a result of these mad vibrations when zooming). So much for leaving the DSLR behind‚Ä¶ Within a week it had gone from taking crisp photos to what looked like a smudged screen. Sometimes this issue was fine though and whenever I took it to exchange it, the store assistant could not replicate the problem. 

I am not a rich person so I‚Äôve had to make do with this sub par phone ever since. 

That‚Äôs not all. And really‚Ä¶ just the beginning. Pretty much a year to the day since purchasing the phone it‚Äôs now just dying.

I can‚Äôt take pictures with it properly and I can essentially use it for a couple of minutes at a time. It‚Äôs almost useless.

I created a new app to connect with people and would love feedback (on app or concept!),"Would love any feedback on a new app I launched in Jan (or feedback on concept!)

Dating apps are really efficient and have solved a huge gap in the 'connection' space but I fee like this mechanism for meeting has only really been using in the dating space. People are lonelier than ever, but also doing less than ever. So I created an app as a hybrid approach for efficiently meeting new people online but the purpose is to connect over a shared hobby to do the hobby together. Social discovery apps are early on the wave but I think they are really important and will become very well used!

Buddee connects users based on a shared hobby. I've tried to keep the sign up process as simple as possible and is completely free. The algorithm will match users within the same search parameters that share a hobby. They can chat first and see if they want to meet.

I've already met some really cool people to surf with through it so selfishly it has served its purpose haha!

Apple finewoven case and wallet (midnight) *positive review*,"Picked this case up a few weeks ago because I was a big fan of apples clear case and the leather case so with this being a replacement for the leather case I was curious. I had low expectations because of the reviews I had seen on this new finewoven material that said it‚Äôs not durable, gets dirty easily, looks old fast and some reviews even saying it‚Äôs Litterally garbage. (Because they said it sucks and it‚Äôs made of recycled garbage) but I‚Äôm sure glad I didn‚Äôt listen to any of that and I bought the new finewoven case and wallet because I wanted to see how I liked it myself. The only thing I notice is the MagSafe charger I use while driving leave a mark on it which you can see in my pictures but other than that I think it is a better material than leather. It‚Äôs silky smooth and feels great to hold. It‚Äôs super soft as well which I really like. It‚Äôs been dropped once or twice fairly hard now and it didn‚Äôt leave any permanent marks on the case so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs durable enough for me. And it‚Äôs washable so if I get anything on it I can scrub it out fairly easily and it drys super fast. One thing I did to enhance its clean ability was sprayed waterproofing clear spray for leather shoes on the case and let that dry. Sprayed the wallet as well. Now water just beads up on it and can easily be wiped off. Hope you guys liked it too if you bought one let me know what you think of it please. ",1708354800,iPhone

I want to get all the photos out of this phone but anytime I try to connect it with my laptop (haven't tried it on a Mac yet), it doesn't allow me to see it because it wants me to trust the device on my phone first but I can't see anything on the screen.

Any recommendations for ways to get my data from my phone? It is an iPhone 13 ",1708354800,iPhone

Siri makes me unlock iPhone to play music app. Was it always this way?,"If I say ""Siri, play music"", it says ""you'll need to unlock your iPhone first"". I'm convinced there was once a time where I could use Siri to start playing music without first having to unlock the phone. Am I just misremembering?

I've searched for an answer to this but the only thing I can find is people saying to turn on ""Allow Siri when locked"". But all that does is allow you to use Siri when it's locked (if it's turned off, you won't get any response at all when you say ""Hey Siri""), and has nothing to do with allowing Siri to open apps for you when the phone is locked.

Anyway, was there not a time when you could open up the music app even with your phone on the table across the room? I'm sure I've done this! lol",1708354800,iPhone

Do you think the iPhone 16 will have better cooling and AI capabilities and is it worth waiting for if I am otherwise happy with my 15 pro Max?,"So my first 15 pro max was bugged. It kept stopping the video at random intervals while recording 4k 60, so I returned it And got a new one.

This new one works great, I have tested it extensively and it recorded 4k 60 for over an hour 5 times, and for over 2 hours 1 time. Each time I stopped it myself, so I am now very happy with the phone. It gets hot but it still keeps recording. 

But I can still return it so I was wondering if I should return it and get a 13 pro max to use while I wait for the 16 pro max. There is like a random leaker who claims the 16 will have graphene cooling. Will that make like a huge difference if true or will even that take a couple generations to get right?

Just cause my phone heats up and reduces brightness quite a bit while playing codm at 120fps. Still totally playable but I‚Äôd like to keep the phone cooler so I can keep playing at max brightness.

I have iPhone 8 that I am waiting for it to die so I can buy iPhone 15 pro max. However, Apple's OS design of how to handle videos/video editing is REALLY making me second guess the iPhone 15 purchase.

I have searched the internet and I could not find someone exploring this exact issue related to video editing on iPhones using Photos app:

If you take a video w/ camera, edit it by cropping (I.E. format to square instead of landscape) + trimming the length (I.E. turn a 10sec video into 5sec), something weird happens internally to the iPhone OS. There will be THREE videos in memory on the phone when I plug it in to my windows PC and look @ the storage.

Video 2) a 2nd IMG\_XXX.MOV file stored in another subfolder (5 second version but NOT cropped)

Video 3) IMG\_EXXX.MOV (5 second version + cropping to square instead of landscape)

&amp;#x200B;

So this causes me to have a lot of questions:

1) Sometimes certain videos with the IMG\_EXXX.MOV designation will refuse to transfer off the iPhone to PC. However, I usually have luck transferring the ORIGINAL IMG\_XXX.MOV off the iPhone USB-&gt;PC. Why would the IMG\_EXXX.MOV sometimes give error? I cannot figure out why it intermittently doesn't work. It's intermittent in the sense that some IMG\_EXXX.MOV files transfer file while others give error. This seems like other people have ran into this issue with photos but I don't see many people discussing videos with this issue? 

2) I tried signing up for iCloud and downloading the problematic video. When I go to download from iCloud I know there are ""Download Options""... ""Unmodified Originals"" vs ""Highest Resolution"" vs ""Most Compatible."" I tried all 3 options and none of them work. The file downloads and just has sound but no video. Also to add further confusion, the iCloud download version seems to only be the full video and not the edited version, even when I select ""Including Edits, Most Compatible""??

3) These videos were taken with the Settings-&gt;Camera-&gt;Formats-&gt;High Efficiency setting. It's not clear to me what this setting actually does in the OS. On paper it's supposed to save in a more modern compression vs the other setting ""Most Compatible"" is supposed to be .jpg and .mp4. I don't know if that somehow is contributing to this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight to this weird behavior w/ edited videos?

&amp;#x200B;

Why this matters to me is I use my phone to record short clips during golf rounds + DIY house projects. I will trim and crop the videos and post them on social media + send to friends quickly after recording. I don't want to have to upload the footage to PC to edit them because that is a lot more work. iPhone has worked great for editing videos in the Photos app and quickly cut clips but iPhone SEVERELY struggles if you need to pull any of those edited clips off the phone onto a PC for longer term storage. This is disappointing because I never had these weird video transfer/storage issues with prior pixel phones.",1709218800,iPhone
Bank accounts emptied after losing my phone - need help to secure my data,"Yesterday I lost my iPhone 14 Pro in a cab and two hours later my bank accounts were emptied. The guy had pretty much full control over my phone and probably knew the password to unlock the screen (He took some screenshots that I found in my iCloud photos (unfortunately without metadata)).

I have followed the phones activity after losing it. 1) The guy reset the password to my apple ID; and 2) He turned off Find my (I was notified by mail). I don't know when he emptied my bank accounts, but probably after this. I also don't know how he gained access to these apps but he did (password/face unlock workaround?). I found some screenshots in iCloud photos he took of sensitive information on the phone (including a picture of me, my social security number and more). Luckily the timeline in Google Maps is intact which I will hand over to the police.

I did gain access to my Apple ID from my Macbook and reset the password. I also logged out off all devices (which he forgot (hence I was still logged on)). I also changed passwords for my Google account, Facebook, Instagram etc. I don't think he has access anymore? The number cannot be reached anymore, so I assume he changed the SIM-card. I also did block the cards to my bank accounts, filed a report to the fraud department in my bank, filed a temporary report to the police etc. I will also have to contact my insurance company.

Questions:

1) Will my Apple ID/iCloud data (pictures etc.) still be accessible for him after he changed the SIM-card? E.g. if he has my password to unlock the screen? Can I do anything to block his access? I did change Apple ID password, but will this prevent him from sneaking around in my pictures and general data if that is still on the phone? Can I do anything so he can't access my iPhones data anymore? Did he lose access to the phones data after I logged out of all devices?

2) What steps would you recommend me to take? I don't know if I'm safe from further ""attacks"" with the steps I've taken so far. Do I need to block my phone number, get another phone number to prevent him from SIM-swapping, change more passwords etc? Have I forgotten to do something crucial?

Huge design flaw,"This is probably the worst design flaw on any apple device. When setting up a device apple encourages you to create an Apple ID which is linked to your iCloud. Generally you use the iCloud.com domain but I think you‚Äôre limited while using anything else. But the point is, if your email gets compromised in anyway you‚Äôre screwed. They give you the option to add another email to your account but it can‚Äôt be iCloud (officially), and if you use for example gmail as your new main email for your account, you can‚Äôt delete your old one. There is no option to edit your previous one to any available alias. I get that your ID is tied to everything you do to the device, but what can one do to not lose all data (notes, photos, Apple Music library) without needing to create a new apple iCloud ID, make new subscriptions to the same services, and try to copy all the data onto the new one.

How I Utilized the iPhone 15 Pro Max's LiDAR Sensor?,"I recently purchased an iPhone 15 Pro Max and noticed a sensor resembling a camera below the rear camera setup ü§î. After some research, I discovered it's a LiDAR sensor, exclusive to the iPhone Pro models.

I wanted to fully utilize this sensor, so I came up with a great idea ü§Ø: use the time it takes for laser light to reflect from an object to calculate distance. After a week of development, I created an app named ""Laser Rangefinder"". Through testing, I found this app to be incredibly accurate in measuring distances, even more so than the built-in measuring app on the iPhone üò±.

I've used this app in my daily life to measure various objects, eliminating the need for a ruler; all I need is an iPhone.

London Oxford Street iPhone Stolen,"Hello all, I need help.

Yesterday I went with my friend after university to open my fast at around 6pm. We got our food and sat down on the first table in Chopstix - Oxford street (towards Tottenham Court road side opposite Mcdonalds and Primark). We both put our phones on the table right next to us watching for the time to strike 6:15pm to open our fast with food in front of us. It was 6:14, a homeless person holding a paper walks into the store right to our table, she comes up to my food and starts putting her hands in it and pointing to her mouth to give her food. She distracted both me and my friend we got irritated trying to tell her to go. when she's leaving my friends goes like to me ""Where's your phone?"". That's when I realised and ran out the store panicking. Unfortunately, it is Oxford Street, busy with people. I had no sight of her it's like she disappeared. Luckily for me I always carry my physical cards so I had no trouble getting the Tube home. Because it was after university, I had my MacBook with me, my friend hotspot me and I tried to track it but they turn it off straight away, I put it on lost mode but it says pending till it'll turn on. It is currently offline. At this time, the store was packed and people were watching me, the lady at the till was still handing me something from my order and I told her my phone just got stolen, she didn't do anything. I went to the manager and explained to him what happened and he goes like ""I'm so sorry, this happens all the time in our store, they target our store, its these Romanian bi\*ches who come and steal in our store, with regards to CCTV, you have to report it to the police and they will come here. However they will take their sweet time."" I then proceeded to call the police and tell them everything, gave them the IMEI and serial number too. They will probably take their ""sweet time"" and I know I'm not getting my phone back. It's just my first year in uni with a struggling part time job and this has been a huge financial hit on me now. At that moment I was so angry, I'm born in London, been living here my whole life, never have I ever experienced anything like this. I am traumatised from eating out now, especially in Central London. I am angry that if the manager has admitted to me that it happens a lot then why haven't they upped their security in the store? If a homeless person walks into a restaurant why don't the staff kick them out? If they know this happens and their store is packed, why can't they shout to just warn us people that thefts happen and to keep your belongings safe? A few months back, I went to Kiko the makeup store on Regent's street and the staff were shouting that pickpockets come and to close your zips. 

Please is there any way I can try to retrieve my phone even if it's not through Apple? :(

And please be careful in London with your phones guys. It is very unsafe.

New iPhone and it won't do _what_? not looking for support here,"Changing phones: I just bought an iPhone SE 3rd gen, thinking of course that I'd be able to keep using Tracfone just like on my SE 2020.

Back when this first occurred I changed the camera module for a cheap replacement one, but after installing that my front camera just stayed completely black/the phone froze when trying to accsess the front camera. So I thought Kay the iPhone isn‚Äòt recognizing the cheap knockoff module.

Hi all,

I'm starting an newsletter called ByteVibes. It is a place where emotions can talk through the latest news in tech. I'm sharing it here so i can know your opinion about it (and hopefully get some subscribers)

Welcome to the 2nd issue of byteVibes, your essential guide through the ever-evolving world of technology. Sent directly to your inbox every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Here is your summarized news:

*Total reading time: 6 minutes*

1- The U.S. government is reportedly creating a list of Chinese chipmaking facilities restricted from receiving advanced tools. This move is seen as an effort to simplify compliance for companies shipping chipmaking tools to China and to patch loopholes that make it difficult for Chinese entities to bypass U.S. export controls. The creation of this list may ease the process for American companies to abide by regulations, while reinforcing restrictions on China's chip industry. The list is expected to be ready within a few months, even as Chinese entities speed up procurement of lithography systems. - [read more](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.agiGSgrzK9HsgdKAbNo-XkUy2fWunkZR23ek5w-AvzWJrcc4rRx0qd0GIQfQn6C8oQpJ7Z-2KzxcDpCv_fwUZgZhFPuHJ2n2v9KWqJhMTL6keXgXj2p6_gqUEAPI2TYjzk6-h7Htw6TIlHBSrt2fmBoMHvaaVDYtk3xtF9wZHJ87usXfVt4yONvn8TKiyuHsNlx2UfXvAzw0nN2m5yWcfcjDE-iJz6UpO6o4z8z0f4o_apgRU04wnDu9LLDc5vB7S-06ccmhaI1w-XmO64PRbFe8iI87kWu_uXnKYwGjsg1YYerveUh2fru_XwC1u7utmHv4uvDpQIfbp5L_7exh4L1RloMbX5dhPiGR8a9f1bU/452/27z2qd7FRG2n4FgZcLC4DQ/h1/h001.kZSS4AoXewi2NhLdSoF9XVFVYsN7o7MCHL8fCuvw4dA)   
Sarcasm üòÜ: Well, it's about time. After all, everyone knows that providing clear instructions is a truly revolutionary concept in the world of bureaucracy and red tape.

2- The article provides a detailed review of several robot mops including the iRobot Braava Jet m6, Ecovacs Deebot T10 Omni, Dreame X30 Ultra, Roborock S8 Pro Ultra, and Samsung Jetbot Mop. It discusses their specifications, features, and performance based on testing. The article concludes with a guide to help differentiate the best robot mops with consideration given to factors such as floor types, mapping, and connectivity. - [read more](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.agiGSgrzK9HsgdKAbNo-Xj1oK8hNQZeGFxmRXKPZoJzhQ5-KxLBcoPcFTXl8zmdxCTTMEpB5G614eE_BqiW1g0ZujtEn6MebcTnnCC0fhMZF-Y4GIFZ3F8FsqJWckj7tSa-gtIIgEvB_9d4Rl2nGR1CtF8WMNC7HUQNGtFhXVAe-htjgYMDVgYpLCKUB8J30e7BPyAYHkHQpueF8YmKCXg/452/27z2qd7FRG2n4FgZcLC4DQ/h2/h001.YpeMtVU33Tf4Olnnh-LhELJcEq8HHG6BaH2eYBp5uyQ)   
Joy üòÉ: It's exciting to see technology advancing to a point where we can have robot mops thoroughly clean our homes. It's like living in a sci-fi movie.

3- Hong Kong tech site HKEPC overclocked an Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090D graphics card to match the performance of the RTX 4090 FE. The 4090D is a cut-down version of Nvidia's top graphics card, designed to meet US sanctions that aim to limit China's access to advanced chips. Differences between the 4090D and the RTX 4090 include fewer CUDA and RT cores, slower clocks, and a lower power cap. Using GPU Tweak III, HKEPC boosted the card's power to 600W, achieving a higher-than-expected performance. - [read more](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.agiGSgrzK9HsgdKAbNo-XkUy2fWunkZR23ek5w-AvzX7OYWJcFjyZqTEgDmDSO_Usujf9OX4NIQMbM090lLU0DbWxIEDpTGWokYZZZPjBoN6WHzMcBDBLgX2VkEeP9qFnkN4DfWUp0oZR5OxDzdXHeluEpFqfJxYuF1mKYLAceNGy-KblFUJJYteOcjk_xpuHJGaG9CuRHvMzNTsLerrbjNTNjSbapk7JrxjfWDu3-okYTUWrgECOIJKo5Nv2p2oQCqWosd15yTTkTeXmY-zqMBCtdSIgwNDeMf-I3-WjbaZ6Mw2KsAktR_OtqR2yhVSxmVNvxmy0k_Cm3nTYLW7oYVK5lGQhU3iG4PGEfRA9ZzmLO_00dezP2gm_ro_I6TsUT5uMsOsadAOplk5BRivew/452/27z2qd7FRG2n4FgZcLC4DQ/h3/h001.LpwIVglVYo5Q7muCzPEuw5xlmR0FBkb9gVK-4Ect6nQ)   
Fear üò®: The implications of this are concerning. If sanctions can be bypassed in such a way, what's stopping misuse of technology for harmful purposes? This sets a dangerous precedent.

4- AMD has disclosed an unannounced AI chip, the MI388X, in its regulatory 10K filing with the SEC. It stated that it could not be shipped to China due to US sanctions on AI processors. This was alongside with other chips like the Instinct MI250, MI300X, and MI300A. It is unclear what specific functions the MI388X chip has. The filing, submitted on January 31, 2024, did not list the China-oriented MI309 chip which was leaked in early March and its unclear if it has been scrapped due to its power contravening US export rules. - [read more](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.agiGSgrzK9HsgdKAbNo-XkUy2fWunkZR23ek5w-AvzWJrcc4rRx0qd0GIQfQn6C821tuWRz810Iqp56m_Z_BTw0n6kg1OkfzyiZsGSKpDY34aDahnclw7cZFd45r6HeRLOdTtCJNLuHVpGvPJRo2SDPQIxzdkv24O4YmOlbxSvzjcn8-Pk2r_ty_KM6hvF5xVYW7jJKOeE-TRb3E7_h4D03dCxXqQXg8WYC6cTlXb4TkfMnkkCyVHRkkV3aASCy15ideUwVGeGH3P3zPEYWN4_3luRmAn7R7I3VtAvPQqHTOdcsuG0jt1NwwoBYf--Kjpr2XLjG3B-NNUSuyy-nzknZByyEVqPX3f4IqASuBs_la1dgaxWgXb0PZ-Mxkx6rF9ugpbBKc4UNP6Fz73zrjug/452/27z2qd7FRG2n4FgZcLC4DQ/h4/h001.P_McYKY_E2n5E5wac4wxp7OwbclXTfaq1w9ejdvAD4c)

5- Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a plan to develop a gaming platform similar to Steam in the Kaliningrad region. It includes creating desktop and portable hardware, an operating system, and a cloud system for gaming. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has until June 15, 2024 to organize and assess the production. However, industry figures indicate that it may be 15 years behind platforms like Steam by the time it launches due to lack of experience and time. - [read more](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.agiGSgrzK9HsgdKAbNo-XkUy2fWunkZR23ek5w-AvzVRmqiwPuL-Jg6eiqv53ATfqdXar18vptMwxHFowiiDl5vFj7eCjcuuE9CuQkyovVZQqdLvl0MV4IVT1MuE9zruoJbKWxXCenG-gzVEPYIRgsEeVDrJRwal_dcoKfFEk8eDpJEXy9jCNj3H_djGmIgudK0pmW4MQJR2WuxbD7LrILPF2oc6s4hoNzV9a5jvtAmW6GN-eCO1ICvPYenu3uQbmdAmJvpYlHs_iBvNjCJeMRtWjwJ48lojJTxuRI9xAvVqSIgESYY5tbiRQzOvoVxwpib2EwZVprh7XD4Khs3CC59mu429HGbboFHueVAFoEwEd1g9CE0yzqpXNfXXe6PM_vJuTc2DfoZ2_Kv3odNWig/452/27z2qd7FRG2n4FgZcLC4DQ/h5/h001.nls0uO63Ql4s006G4INPyB8WpnSWWv8YX-IS2j86NPs)

Risks of Buying Ebay Iphones--looking at IPhone 15 Pro Max,"**Does anyone really get a good reliable deal buying and Ebay Iphone?**

I'm looking at the Iphone 15 pro max

The prices on the new ones seem to be so close to the Apple store--so I wouldn't buy to save $50 or $100 .

The refurbished (at $200 to $300 savings) with some sentiment there's an Ebay guarantee or pay pal protection are those ok? can you put apple insurance on an iphone bought through Ebay?

Straight up used--at savings of $300 to $400----sure I read a sincere advert, pictures, reasons the phones being sold--just a small scratch in the case but is one getting fleeced or getting something with some bigger defect? Given the model has only been out since September-if the phone had some warranty issue, wouldn't a used seller have mobilized that warranty prior to selling.

Motives---convince me to just buy it at the Apple Store

I then kept it on and off different chargers throughout the day, also putting it on my mag safe.

Since I‚Äôve got the original box with the serial number of the air pod pro 2nd gen that I was supposed to have, can apple block it somehow ? ",1710946800,iPhone

Question about iPhone camera features?,"So I was really thinking about switching to iPhone, but one of the main things stopping me is the camera.
On my S22 I have photo, video, portrait, panorama, night, single take, slow motion hyperlapse, and one of the main ones, pro photo mode
Ok pro I can adjust, ISO, shutter speed, EV and white balance.
I mainly love this feature bec I can have a 30 second exposure and take good photos of the stars.
Does apple have these features on their camera? Or is it possible to get these features? The main one being the pro photo mode.

iPhone SE: 15 Plus Apps = Music Fails to Play,"Hello All,

(1) I have a paid Dropbox account on my iPhone SE. All music data files (.flac) are available ""off-line"" and are on my phone in the NAND chip flash memory.

(2) Since I listen to classical music, my compositions are in folders. I must be able to play single compositions, i.e., a folder with mutliple tracks.

(3) The 15+ audio players I have tried all fail: a. When I browse, I never get a complete hierarchy of my data and I never can find my Dropbox folder which contains my music, b. For some apps, I can login to [dropbox.com](https://dropbox.com) but that would defeat my purpose. Why should I download the music that's already on my phone, c. I'm not able to transfer folders to Files as I get error messages.

(4) I can play individual tracks but for classical music this is a big problem.

Yesterday she stood up an hour before me to go to work and dressed for a high of 18C (64F) as told by her iPhone while I was asking Google Home and dressed for a high of 28C (82F). Yesterday the latter was definitely true!
I first thought she maybe misread it, so this morning I checked my iPhone and it tells me a high of 14C (57F) while Google Home says 20C (68F) PLUS when I take a look to the weather app on my iPhone it also tells a high of 20C (57F) - what‚Äôs wrong with the forecast of the sleep schedule??",1711810800,iPhone

Is it still possible to put music on my iPhone?,"So, have an iPhone 8 that I bought from a friend. It has served me well for a few years now, as I'm not a super-heavy phone user and don't need the latest model/cameras, etc. One thing I DO use my iPhone for, however, is music - which I listen to all the time. I've got old habits when it comes to music management - I don't use Spotify or Apple Music but instead sync MP3s from iTunes to my phone. Recently, I updated my phone because my banking app wouldn't let me login without downloading the latest software update. Fair enough, I thought. However, now when I try to connect my iPhone to my Macbook Pro, it says that iTunes can't recognize it. For reference, I'm running MacOS Mojave 10.14.4 and my iPhone is now running iOS 16.7.5. Do I have any option here other than updating the OS on my Macbook Pro? It's an older machine and I'm worried about some outdated software on it not working with the new OS.

Missing Alarms - Ringer volume lowered when receiving calls with Bluetooth headphones connected ,"Hi, 

I have an iPhone 15 Pro with iOS 17.4.1. I have my ‚ÄúRingtone &amp; Alerts‚Äù on the highest volume, with the ‚ÄúChange with Buttons‚Äù toggled Off. My phone is typically on Silent Mode, so the ringer volume mainly impacts my alarms.

I‚Äôve noticed my alarms were ringing at a very low volume, and when I check the ringer setting I find it set to very low volume. 

I came to realize that when I‚Äôm using my Bluetooth headphones (Sony WH-XB910N), and I receive a phone call the ringer volume automatically gets lowered, but it never resets after I disconnect the headphones, leaving the ringer volume at a very low level. 

This has caused me to miss several alarms. When I receive a phone call I can see the ringer volume being lowered in the Dynamic Island. I understand lowering the ringer volume if phone is not on Silent mode while headphones are on, but it should be reset to normal levels after you remove the headphones. 

Has anyone run into this issue? Is there any solutions? Seems like a bug to me?",1712674800,iPhone

Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread," 

**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**

**Battery health**

Battery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.

Apple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).

You can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).

You can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).

‚Äã

**Battery life**

Issues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:

1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use
2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application
3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging

If you experience issues with your battery:

1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).
2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.
3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)
4. Consider restoring your device.
5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).

‚Äã

[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.

* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)
* Remove apps from background app refresh
* Ensure auto lock is on
* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness
* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display
* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life

‚Äã

[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.

* Avoid extreme temperatures
* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case
* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",1712674800,iPhone

Vibration and notification problems," 

Hi everyone!

I have always used the iPhone 15 pro max in silent mode, removing all noise and even vibration. Now that I have bought an Apple Watch SE I would like to have notifications with vibration on the watch, but when I found myself activating all types of vibration on the iPhone, those notifications such as Whatsapp, Telegram, etc., vibration doesn't work, but only those of the call and SMS.

As I said, for calls and SMS it works, so the vibration is activated on ""Touch"" and I put the haptic feedback always played and the system haptic feedback is also activated. Not only does vibration work on Apple Watch, but also on iPhone itself.

Anyone have any idea how to do this? I'm using iOs 17.4.1",1712674800,iPhone

How to best protect glass back?,"Let me start this by saying yes, I always have a case on my phone, and no I do not drop it frequently but sometimes accidents happen.
In the past two years, I have had my back glass break three times. 

The first time I feel was pretty standard, my iPhone X fell out of my back pocket while I was running an event at work. I wasn‚Äôt too terribly mad about it because to me it was just a sign that I needed to get a better case to protect it better, and the phone already had a couple of other issues, so I ended up replacing it anyway. 

The second time, my iPhone 13 fell out of my hands when one of my roommates bumped into me, and the back glass broke again. This was really upsetting because I spent $70 on an Otterbox case specifically to make sure that it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, but it did. I got the phone repaired through Apple, and it was all fine.

Until this morning, when it tumbled off of my bed (not even an arms length to the ground) onto the carpet. It is in the most protective case I could find with a screen protector and everything, and still the back glass cracked. 

So what am I doing wrong here? Is there literally anything else I can do to stop this from happening? Because three times and I‚Äôm feeling really disheartened since I feel like I‚Äôve done everything short of glue my phone into my hand to prevent this from happening.

t-mobile or apples issue?,To start this I will say this morning I had T-mobile and they charge WAY too much for just my one line. I also have an SE apple watch and was paying $156 ( plus an extra $15 they take out of my account ). I switched to Verizon today because my job provides 18% off Verizon phone bills. Got a new phone and watch and tmobile said they wont take back the devices until i pay them off. All of a sudden RIGHT after i switched my number to my new phone my ‚Äúold‚Äù iphone( 15 ) started turning off and on. So now i cant transfer anything or even back anything up. Almost positive t-mobile is the reason because i cant see any reason it would start doing that AFTER I switched to Verizon. Its so annoying.

Hello!

We are team Pickyz and we wanted to share our new app called SuperAlarm. If you‚Äôre a heavy sleeper who struggles to wake up, this feature-packed alarm app is designed just for you.

Top features:

1. ‚ÄúMissions‚Äù you must complete to turn off the alarm, ensuring you get out of bed. We‚Äôre starting with math missions but let us know what other challenges you‚Äôd like to see!
2. Custom alarm tones selected by our team to jolt you awake. Tell us your favorite alarm sounds and we‚Äôll add them.
3. Set a daily memo that displays after you turn off the alarm. Start your morning with a motivating message or reminder to kickstart your day right!
4. When you snooze, SuperAlarm goes into iPhone‚Äôs dynamic island to display time left until next ring.
5. Clean, intuitive interface combined with powerful functionality. Most feature-rich alarm apps are expensive, but SuperAlarm is totally free, supported by unobtrusive ads. We‚Äôll be adding an affordable one-time purchase option to go ad-free.

We built SuperAlarm because we were frustrated with oversleeping and found existing alarm apps lacking in features, design, or price.

Our goal was to create the ultimate alarm clock experience to help you start your day right. SuperAlarm is available now on the App Store. Please check it out¬†[here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6480463426)¬†and share your feedback - we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions and feature requests. We‚Äôre committed to making this the most powerful, customizable and user-friendly alarm clock app available.",1713538800,iPhone

Alarm app recommendation,"Hi,

I need some recommendations for an alarm clock app that works, that can set an alarm for specific day and preferably can disable alarm for the next day only (like android has). It would also be great if it shows a notification few minutes before it rings, so I can disable it if I'm already awake (like android has). Why is it so hard for Apple to make a good alarm clock app...

You all probably know why I need a new app, but if someone is still curious, here are the two main reasons:

- You can't set an alarm for specific day. Let's say it Monday and i need an alarm for Friday. It's Impossible. And yes, i know there are workarounds with callendar app, with setting it to repeat on Fridays, or whatever, but that's just BS, I'm not using 3 apps just to set alarms or remebering that I have to disable the alarm or it's gonna wake me up next week for no reason. 

- My alarm just went off few minutes later. Like I had it set to 7:30, it went off 7:41. Not a big diference, but I'm not risking it to go off like an hour later.",1713538800,iPhone

Is total voice control of the telephone functionality for disabled person possible?,"I'm trying to setup a phone for a disabled person, who isn't able to use their hands to control the phone. I've tried multiple approaches on Android, bricking two phones ... so that seems to be a dead end. Is this possible on iPhone, maybe with the combination of a bluetooth speaker?

The phone needs to do four things via voice control:

1. Pick up incoming calls. (Automatic pick-up is fine too)
2. Put the call on the speaker. (Automatic to speaker is fine too)
3. Make outgoing calls by naming the recipient.
4. Hang up an existing call.

How do I turn off iPhone 15 Plus screen white correction?,"Google is not helping much because it believes this issue is camera related, so let me be clear: *I am not talking about my camera‚Äôs white balance*

Problem with a new iPhone ,"Hello! My wife had a iPhone X for a while while, but lately she purchased used iPhone 13 Pro. She configurated it, sent the files etc. She loves her new phone, but she bought it second-hand from a phone shop and it has lots of scratches. She now wants to exchange it for another one, in different colour and in better shape. To do it, she needs to return the current one to the shop and they'll send another one.

Here is the problem - we cannot send all the content to the iPhone X for those couple of days, because iPhone 13 Pro is on iOS 17 and iPhone X doesn't support it. I tried to do a iCloud back-up, but she can't download it on the new phone. 

Is it possible to somehow store her content on the current phone (iPhone 13 Pro) on iCloud so she could have the same phone when she gets a new one? Any help would be really appreciated! ",1714402800,iPhone

If you have a 14 pro or 15/15 pro do phone call actually work properly? 

I know cellphone are more tablets now.. but we make a lot of phone calls so for us it needs to be a phone first.

It's not a carrier issue, changed mine for a s24 and all the issues are gone but my wife absolutely wants an iphone since she has a macbook.

So do 14 pro and 15/15 pro work properly as a phone? Or is she better off with a 12 pro",1714402800,iPhone

Help Needed: HDMI Adapter Issue with iPhone 15 Pro,"Hi everyone,

I've run into a bit of an issue and could use some help. I recently purchased a female HDMI to female HDMI adapter to connect my iPhone 15 Pro to the TV.

Here's the setup:
- There's an existing HDMI cable connected to the TV, which has been plastered over. This cable definitely works as I can connect other devices to it without any problems.
- The HDMI adapter I bought also works. I tested it by connecting my laptop via HDMI to the adapter, and then into the HDMI cable to the TV. Everything displays perfectly.

However, when I try to use the adapter with my iPhone 15 Pro, I get no signal. 

Important points:
- The existing HDMI to HDMI cable to the TV works.
- The USB-C to HDMI adapter from the iPhone also works when plugged directly into the TV.
- The new female-to-female HDMI adapter works with my laptop.

So, why isn't my phone working when I use the HDMI adapter, but it works when I plug the phone directly into the TV? Is there a minimum spec the connector needs to meet?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",1715266800,iPhone
WiFi Calling and VoLTE to VoWiFi Handover Issues ,"Hi everyone,

I've noticed an issue with my home router (ZTE - F8648P) where my iPhone's WiFi Calling doesn't automatically connect. I need to toggle airplane mode for it to work. Additionally, when I am on a VoLTE call, my phone does not attempt to handover to VoWiFi when the call/session is placed over LTE.

However, when I test the same scenarios at work with a different access point (Ubiquiti) and another service provider, everything works fine. My phone connects automatically to WiFi Calling, and the handover from VoLTE to VoWiFi occurs without any issues.

I suspect the problem might be related to the MTU settings. When I trace the WiFi interface on my phone, I don't see any attempt to connect to the ePDG from my home access point. I wonder if the iPhone detects that the MTU is insufficient to send DF packets over my home AP for reconnections or handovers from one access to the other.

Has anyone faced a similar issue or have any insights on this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!",1715266800,iPhone

I contacted apple and they said the Bluetooth range was only 10 meters which seems hysterically low. I feel like I'm being gaslit. I didn't even think about Bluetooth range before. I could go hundreds of feet away from my phone with my airpod pro 1's, through walls and everything and they wouldn't skip a beat. I remember using these same speakers with my 11 Pro and being easily 100 feet away without even thinking about it. Now if I'm outside and 30 feet away from my phone and move my airpod pro 2's around a corner by 1 inch they will completely stop playing music. I have restarted my phone multiple times obviously and also forgotten and re-paired with each device multiple times and even tried deleting the accompanying apps that go along with the speakers.

Am I crazy or is something going on here with the range on the new stuff? ",1716130800,iPhone

Get paid watching ads FAST! LEGIT!,"So I'm 20 years old and have been struggling to find a part-time job for a year now and I have been in the glumps far as my mood for a while because I can't improve in life if I have NO MONEY! but no one wants to give me a job! so two days ago I got on Reddit and stumble across a Reddit page that said ""how to make money online"" of course I have already gone to YouTube, again and again, to see if there was any way to make money online or just any way to make money in general without giving money away or without waiting for a job offer that's been taking what feels like years to come. I found a post claiming that you could LEGIT get paid by only watching ads. of course, you have to watch hella ads but of course, I did it anyway because I wanted to see if it was legit, and...IT IS.

iPhone XR - Boot Loop,"Hello Redditors,

  
Can anybody give me some advice for the following situation please?

  
Almost certainly due to some water damage, the face ID stopped working on my iPhone, so I gave the good old reset a go. This turned out to be a big mistake as my device is now stuck in a boot loop. 

The reset does nothing while in this loop, so I've ruled that out. 

I have read of various third party softwares that claim to be able to fix this issue, however I have read mixed reviews. Has anyone had any success with any of these softwares?

My next steps are to connect to iTunes to see if I can restore / update my device, however I am anticipating problems as my storage was also full (I know this may also be contributing to the cause of the boot loop also)

Another option I intend to explore, is to have a technician disable the face ID hardware, in the hope that removing this fault from the equation will allow the device to boot up.

Any help / feedback / advice from anyone thats had a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou!

Stolen iPhone...,"Stolen iPhone...

Hello. I got robbed off of my iPhone 14 Pro Max on January 4th. It had Find My activated. It was screen locked and it had Face ID and Passcode. It was linked to my two phone numbers (2FA). Note that I did not have any other Apple device.  I will explain the series of events.

4th January: iPhone gets stolen at around 7pm. 3 hours later, I signed in to iCloud Find My on web and marked device as Lost.

5th January: 4pm. Email from Apple that Lost Mode has been enabled (I guess it came online?). Another email almost immediately that my iPhone had been found.

7th January: I logged into iCloud Find My randomly.

9th January 5pm: Got a text from Apple (genuine because it the same sender 'Apple' from the thread sending many messages containing OTP for 2FA previously) that ""Your iPhone 14 Pro Max has been accessed by Passcode"". How did these guys crack the Passcode? (It was a six-digit number only code)

9th January 6:46pm: Email from Apple that my Apple ID password had been reset

9th January 6:52pm: Email from Apple that Find My been disabled.

10th January (about 7:30pm): I was logging in to iCloud Find My when I realized I could no longer sign in. I check my emails only to be shocked by the events of 9th (emails from Apple). Seeing I had no other Apple Device. I made an Account Recovery Request at iforgot.apple. I had to wait for a whole week.

15th January: Successfully reset my Apple ID account password and removed the iPhone as a Trusted Device (but did not remove it in Find My.

Around 20th January: Apple Music which I was now using in Android prompted me for password which was very unusual. After many attempts entering the correct password, it still denied me access. I researched and realized that Apple does that if there has been too many attempts to get into an account. My suspicion is that the thieves may have attempted to gain access to the phone with the new password they created after resetting, unknown to them that I had long recovered access to my account. Was this the case? My biggest worry was losing access to iCloud photos.

Kindly let me know if I did it correctly. 

How did they crack my passcode?

Is the phone usable? Was it reset and sold/used?

P.S: I reported the matter to the police promptly.

Question about factory resetting older iPhones,"I have a handful older iPhones that I no longer use still with their boxes, so I thought it'd best to just reset them and list them on Ebay for a little bit of money.

I'm no longer an iPhone user and am not very familiar with iPhones and iTunes anymore, so apologies if my issue is basic.

Resetting them has been relatively straight forward, however when they are plugged into my laptop and synced to iTunes, it labels the phones with my name. This makes me cautious as to if the phones are being properly reset, as I don't want to sell them with any of my information on them (obviously).

What am I doing wrong or what am I missing to fully factory reset them?

Since I currently rock the s24 ultra, I would like to know how the experience has been for anyone that has switched from android to iOS. 

I have a person who wants to swap their iPhone 15 pro max for my S24 Ultra and that's why I'm contemplating. 

I have never really owned and iPhone ever. I have the MacBook air m3 and the iPad pro 6th gen. Absolute beasts. Love them. ",1716130800,iPhone
Is applecare worth it if you plan to use the phone for 4-5 years?,"Wanting to buy an Iphone 15+/16+ by the time apple releases the new iPhones. Not sure if applecare is worth it if I wanna use it for 4-5 years. Take these into consideration :

-I have another android phone that I normally use for heavy-memory stuff like gaming/downloading movies so normally this iPhone would be used for anything other than that because I love apple's ecosystem. However, I own multiple airtags and airpods so my iPhone batt\*ry would still drain faster despite not using it for games.

-I owned an iPhone 11 without any applecare. So far, I've had 2 LCD replacements and 1 batt\*ry replacements. All of these happened after 2+ years of owning. It costed me around $250SGD which would be the same price if I had applecare&amp;paid for the service fees. The only difference is that if I've done it in Apple, the replacements given would be the original ones.

-Not sure if applecare is as worth it as with airpods pros. A lot of people had said that you can get a change of batt\*ry/pods/case by paying the service fee hence that's why people recommend it. I'm not sure if I can do this with iPhones. The only thing that I want to get from applecare is replacing the batt\*ry by the end of the applecare tenure. Aside from that, screen replacements too hence I'm gonna get the original parts.

-The way i use iphones, I use it with care but sometimes a bit too careless. I buy screen protectors/good phone cases like OtterBox but I still use it in rain or when I take breaks during swimming. Would often use it when charging too (especially when batt\*ry health is lower)

-Would be using it for 4-5 years before replacing a new phone. Until then, I'm buying new android phones to use for other heavy memory stuff.

With these conditions, is it still worth it to buy applecare for a new iphone?",1716130800,iPhone

YouTube App closing on pause (iPhone),"Problem: YouTube app (Premium) closes after pressing pause on ear buds/headphones/car head unit.

This is iPhone 11 running IOS 17.5.1, however this issue has been present on all previous versions I‚Äôve used.

I use YouTube premium which gives the ability to download and also listen with screen off (also no YouTube ads which is nice). I use this to download long form videos such as iceberg compilations ect to listen too while working/doing chores where wifi signal isn‚Äôt the best or non existent.

The issue occurs when pausing on either the phone screen, or using button on headphones/earbuds/car stereo.
When pressing ‚Äúplay‚Äù again nothing happens. I then open phone to find that YouTube app has been closed. So I open it again, find the download, find the spot it stopped at, then play it again.
This is quite annoying, as it renders the pause option basically useless.

I assume this problem is IOS‚Äôs aggressive memory conservation or something, but that would seem unnecessary due to the fact that YouTube is the only app running (apart from non user-closable IOS apps and functions)

I have plenty of storage (58gb free).
Low power mode is off.

Does anyone have a suggestion to prevent this problem?
(I could use another app for listening but YouTube has the creators I prefer)

(This doesn‚Äôt seem to occur on airplane mode - which could be a reason)

Thanks in advance. Yes it‚Äôs a small problem but keen to see if anyone else has experienced this and if there is a quick fix I may be able to use without changing phone, app, ect.

Two weeks ago I decided it was likely a hardware issue and took her to trade her phone in for a new IPhone 15 Pro Max.

I called the carrier and we did a bunch of remote tech support/resets and nothing worked. They told me they‚Äôd elevate it and get back to me but never did. 

This week I took my mom to the Genius Bar. After several tests, a diagnostic they ran in the back indicated the phone had a hardware issue and needed something replaced. I mentioned that I was surprised it was a hardware problem bc it had definitely been an issue with the previous phone. They did the repair and after setting up the eSIM the apple genius told me the phone would display the SOS service indicator for a while and sent me home. Even after setting the phone up as a new phone (I did not restore from back up) and bars appearing on the phone, it still did not work. 

I called Apple immediately and they ran a bunch more remote tests and then told me they‚Äôd have to elevate the issue and call me back, bringing me to today. After going through a few more tests with an apple tech person, they told me that there is an ‚Äúemerging issue‚Äù apple very recently sent out an internal notice about. It‚Äôs essentially the issue I described- there are reports of iPhones that cannot use their cellular data.  She told me there is no resolution right now and the best thing to do is keep updating the phone when updates come out. 

It‚Äôs absolutely crazy to me that they have no solution to solve an issue that essentially makes a brand new iPhone a brick when off WiFi. It‚Äôs also crazy there‚Äôs been no official statement from Apple on this. I‚Äôve anecdotally heard from people I know that they know other ppl who have had this issue, but haven‚Äôt heard it firsthand. So, posting here both for awareness (and so that no one gets duped into a 600$ repair to not fix the problem-hers was covered under warranty but they told us that would‚Äôve been the cost without it) and to ask if anyone else has been experiencing this issue.

Shitty turn of events here,"So yesterday, I got rear ended. I have a dash cam/rear cam on my car.

Momento 6 is the brand, app is called the same.

Anyway, I get home, download the files on to my phone through their app, go inside to upload them to my email, and they‚Äôre no where to be found. 

So I take the sd card from the camera, plug it into the adapter, and the fucking thing(sd card) broke in half. So I have no footage of this guy rear ending me. It was a minor accident and both vehicles were drivable just fine(4 holes from license plate in my bumper), so police report wasn‚Äôt needed in our case. 

Good news is, by the time I‚Äôd gotten home, his insurance had already called me back and set up a date to get my car fixed as well as a rental, and they took responsibility and didn‚Äôt even need the video. 

But! I would love to know where these damn .AVI videos went to on my phone. I watched them, I downloaded them, they‚Äôre in this fucking phone somewhere, but where? 

Basically, where does iPhone stick this damn file? I‚Äôve plugged it into my MacBook, and I cannot find it at all.

Why doesn't the iPhone 15 / 15 Plus have a 120hz screen?,"Genuine question. It's 2024 and apple still uses a slow 60hz panel for a 800-1000 dollar phone.

Why? What justifies this action? 

A 120hz screen is a bigger deal than many of you might think. 
It gives a feeling of smoothness you can't achieve by simply having a faster cpu.

MagSafe 5k Power Bank Suggestions ,"howdy! 

looking for some recommendations on a **MagSafe 5k power bank**. 

I‚Äôve spent countless hours researching various brands and models, from Anker to Belkin.

I‚Äôve considered the 622 from Anker but every one says the heat produced is quite significant, which I know is inevitable considering the inefficiencies of wireless charging and heat dissipation. 

I‚Äôve also looked at the Belkin Boost MagSafe power bank, both directly from Apple (supports Qi2 wired) and from Belkin. 

Speed of charging is of least concern.

iphone 15 pro max verizon esim lock situation,"hi guys,

i recently bought an iphone 15 pro max from a seller in offerup. The device is in good conditions and works fine. The seller had it listed as ""carrier unlocked"" and claimed that I'd be able to connect it to my t-mobile network. i come to realize that attempting to connect it to my carrier the next day, the phone is sim locked and tried reaching back to the seller but he ended up ghosting me.

I did a imei report and the device is clean and does not come back as stolen/lost. After some research, it turns out that the device was unpaid for and was sold to me as is. I googled verizon's locking policy and according to their policy page, their prepaid device policy will still unlock after 60 days as long as the device hasn't been stolen nor bought fraudulently, which apparently isn't the case according to the imei report.

my doubt is that the iphone has no active line with verizon and im not sure if this would apply for this scenario. the imei report claimed that it has been bought since may 10th 2024 and my guess it hasn't completed the 60 day lock policy.

whatsapp help.,"I recently got a new iPhone, and I didn't know that it is only possible to transfer WhatsApp data from the setup screen.

Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread," 

**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**

**Battery health**

Battery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.

Apple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).

You can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).

You can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).

‚Äã

**Battery life**

Issues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:

1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use
2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application
3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging

If you experience issues with your battery:

1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).
2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.
3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)
4. Consider restoring your device.
5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).

‚Äã

[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.

* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)
* Remove apps from background app refresh
* Ensure auto lock is on
* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness
* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display
* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life

‚Äã

[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.

* Avoid extreme temperatures
* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case
* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",1718722800,iPhone

Seeking Advice on Effective Screen Time Controls for Teen Daughter‚Äôs Phone Usage,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice on managing my daughter‚Äôs phone usage. Lately, she‚Äôs been getting too many detentions at school, and as a deterrent, I‚Äôve decided to lock down her phone to essential apps only (calls, text messages, maps, etc.) whenever she gets a detention.

I‚Äôve been using the Screen Time feature on my iPhone to do this. Here‚Äôs how I currently manage it:

1.   Go to Screen Time on my phone.
2.   Select her name.
3.   Go to Downtime and set it to 06:01-06:00.

This effectively gives her just one minute per day on non-essential apps before the downtime kicks in. However, this method isn‚Äôt foolproof. My daughter has discovered a way around it by simply turning her iPhone off and on, which resets her free few minutes each day. I know she doesn‚Äôt know the password as I change it randomly every few days.

I‚Äôve attached a picture of her Screen Time usage over the past few days, and you can see she has 3+ hours on Snapchat despite my efforts.

So, my questions are:

1.	Is there a more efficient way to lock down her phone?
2.	How can I stop her from resetting the time by turning her phone off and on?
3.   Shouldn‚Äôt Apple have a more robust solution for this, like a ‚Äúgrounded mode‚Äù that can‚Äôt be bypassed easily?

I‚Äôm impressed by her commitment to finding a workaround, but I wish she‚Äôd apply that same dedication to other areas of her life. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",1718722800,iPhone

Just upgraded from an iPhone SE 2 to an iPhone 14. Holy moly the difference with everything is insane.,"So I saw a post on here a while ago raving about how much louder and better the 14's speakers are compared to the 13's. I have multiple family members with a 13 Pro Max and they're really loud but also really distorted. So I figured why not compare my new 14's speakers to my SE 2's? So I told Siri on both phones to put the volume at halfway on both phones for it to be fair/equal and then played some music. Wow, people weren't kidding. The jump is bigger for me because I switched from 7 year old iPhone 8 speaker design to a 2 year old design, but regardless it's still insanely better in terms of quality and volume. 80% on the SE sounds like 50% on the 14.

The camera did disappoint me though if I have to be honest. I expected a bigger jump but the quality is only a little bit better, and the measly 5X digital zoom remains. Kinda crazy that they didn't bump it up to 10X until the new 15. I do see that the software is doing the heavy lifting though, it optimizes the image to look way better than it did before.

The jump to the 4.7 in display to a 6.1 in OLED display is wild too though. Apple's LCD displays feel like an OLED until they're tasked with displaying a solid black. This phone does sooo much better with black. I almost feel like it's too big though, and that Apple is making a mistake with supposedly making the new iPhone screen bigger. But I'm sure I'll get used to it and then refuse to switch to a smaller phone lol. Something in between would be nice, like the 5.4"" or 5.8"" display on the iPhone 12/13 Mini and iPhone X. Speaking of the Mini phones, I hope Apple uses them for the new SE and not the rumored XR, the current SE camera is already showing its age and it's basically the same as the XR's. Also, the XR has a 6.1"" screen, which would be too big for an SE phone IMO.

So yeah, just wanted to share my awesome new experiences with the 14, and apparently rant about their screen sizes and the new SE at the end there lol.",1718722800,iPhone

"Weird iPhone, Insta, and Bank Account Issues","I‚Äôm having strange trouble with my iPhone, certain Apps, and my bank account that Apple can‚Äôt seem to figure out.

About two weeks ago, I got a notification on my phone saying someone had gained access to my iPhone (it wasn‚Äôt a text message, it wasn‚Äôt an email, it was like when you give somebody at Apple permission to share your screen - I‚Äôm not sure what that‚Äôs called but it was just some thing that popped up on my phone). Immediately after that happened, I tried to call Apple but my phone wasn‚Äôt able to make a phone calls. Then I tried to call a few other people, and my phone wouldn‚Äôt call them either. Then I went into my settings and removed devices I didn‚Äôt recognize and I was able to make calls after that. I called Apple and we went through so many different safety checks and on their end, they told me that everything looked good and that if somebody had access to my phone that wouldn‚Äôt preclude me from making phone calls so that must be a coincidence. But I think the timing is very peculiar that I got a notification saying someone had access my phone through Apple and all of a sudden I couldn‚Äôt make phone calls. 
Then I started having trouble with Instagram. I have two accounts, one for personal and one for business. I don‚Äôt really go on my personal one very often, but do go on my business account every day. On my personal account, I got a notification from Instagram saying that it looks like there was ‚Äúautomated activity‚Äù on my account. I‚Äôm assuming that meant it seemed like my phone was being used as like a bot farm to automatically like certain posts and comment or something. But I had barely used that account and was just using it to  check my messages, make a comment here or there, but nothing abnormal. Instagram said that if that behavior continued, they would either temporarily suspend my account or permanently disable that account. A few days later, someone I know who is a contact of mine, texted me asking me why I Zelled them $400. I said that I did not Zelle them $400 but then I checked my bank account and sure enough it showed that I had Zelled them $400, even though I personally had not. It showed that on July 1st I had set up an automatic payment to them every month for $400. But I hadn‚Äôt sent the money for days prior so it doesn‚Äôt make sense that even by accident I would have gone into Zelle on a different day and set up recurring payment for $400 every month. But they don‚Äôt have access to my phone and they‚Äôre incredibly trustworthy to the point where they asked me why I Zelled them $400 so I know they had nothing to do with it. That was the only erroneous charge on my bank account. 
A couple days after that, I got another notification pop up on my phone that said someone had access my phone again, but neither Apple nor I could find any other devices that had access to my phone. We checked in settings and checked in the Find My app.

I had changed my passwords on my apps on my bank account and I had set up two factor authentication for my business  instagram but had forgotten to set up set up for my personal Instagram. And as of yesterday, I got another message on my personal account saying that there was this ‚Äúautomated activity‚Äù on my account and again they would suspend my account or permanently disable it if it continued. I went ahead and set up two factor authentication on that account as well and changed my password again.

This all started a day or two after I went on a date with this man. I left my phone with him when I went to the bathroom and he held it while we were dancing. I have a six digit passcode on my phone. I don‚Äôt have facial recognition to open my phone. He did take a bunch of pictures of me and now I‚Äôm thinking that maybe he did that to try and open my phone but that‚Äôs very paranoid thinking and also I don‚Äôt have that feature set up on my phone. So the only way someone could have access to my phone would be to know my passcode or for me to have left it unlocked and not realized it while I went to the bathroom. it never occurred to me that my phone wouldn‚Äôt be safe with him, but now I‚Äôm really questioning things. The timing is so peculiar and he works in IT and software engineering. Is there any way he could have accessed my phone? Is there any way he could still be accessing my phone? 
I can‚Äôt understand why somebody would go into my bank account and set up our recurring payment to one of my contacts for $400. And it doesn‚Äôt make sense that I would have done it by accident considering I wasn‚Äôt even making a payment to them or anyone on that day. 

But regardless of who is doing this and why, I just want it to stop and want to feel like my phone is secure again. So if you have any advice for me, please let me know.
and needless to say, I didn‚Äôt go out with that guy again. Thank you.",1719586800,iPhone

Press &amp; hold the power button until the screen goes black.

As soon as the screen goes black press &amp; hold the volume up button AND the power button. Keep holding them until the Apple logo appears AND THEN DISAPPEARS, then release.

Iphone 12 Pro Max randomly went to bootloop,"Last night I left my phone on my table while playing on my computer, Then saw that it went into a boot loop.

This morning I managed to fix it for moment, initially i thought that the bootlooping was because of my storage becoming too full, so in the time that i was able to access my phone i deleted atleast around 8-10gb of data, but while looking thru my setting i saw that my Face Id wasn't working anymore and True Tone didn't show up. 

I tried to fix the face id + true tone issue by simply restarting my phone but it just went into another bootloop.

THINGS I'VE TRIED :   
- Hard Resetting it by using volume and side buttons

- Putting it into recovery mode and trying to both update and restore (it prepares the iphone for it but the phone just goes on the bootloop causing the process to stop)

-Putting it into DFU mode, which when trying to restore makes it go into recovery mode (after leaving it at that it shows that (Iphone could not be restored due to an unknown error ""4013"")

P.S : I managed to fix it by using IMyFoneFixxpo to force it outside the restore screen and it just booted up, but as  said it booted it up issues (Face Id and True Tone)

I don't remember if the last time I was texting Girl #3 if I was on my computer and that's why her messages went there instead of my phone for the next couple of days. I don't have read receipts on either device.

Question: How do I prove I never received those messages on my phone, and that I read them TODAY on my computer for the first time because I thought to check there after she confronted me.

She told me she believes me and we worked it out but if it were the other way around I know I would need proof to really believe her in the back of my mind. Please help.",1719586800,iPhone

Has anyone tried the app Retro?,"It advertises to be a replacement for Instagram for sharing photos in a more private nature with small groups of people.

Email and phone number to sign up of course, then prompting me to put my ""Full Name"" which is like why do they need to put an emphasis on ""full""? Forcing you to upload numerous photos to finish the signup process (mind you the app is meant for posting more personal photos that you'd only want people close to you to see). Asking if you would like to give them your address to ""send a postcard to yourself"" of one of your own pictures? And lastly forcing you to give them access to your contacts and send out three invites to people from your contacts in order to access the rest of the app. Idk maybe I'm just too high and paranoid but I never finished the sign up process because I didn't want to send invitations to an app that I couldn't even try out for myself yet.",1719586800,iPhone

"Constantly getting ""no service""","Since 2 days ago, I am constantly getting ""no service"" on my iphone 8.

During this time the connection is extremely bad, and even simple whatsapp text messages often take a minute to be sent.

  
It happened out of nowhere. Didn't drop the phone or anything. The only thing is that the days before I've been toggling airplane mode on and off several dozen times per day, to save battery. Also I upgraded my phone plan to get more data each month.

  
I tried all of these things:

- turn on/off airplane mode

- restart phone (helps sometimes)

- reset network settings (helps sometimes)

- remove/put in again SIM card

- install newest ios version (16.7.8). This itself did not work, it was getting stuck under ""preparing update"", was forced to install it via itunes

- use the same SIM card on another phone

  
When using the card on another phone, it seemed to work perfectly. So this should not be an issue with the card itself, or with my plan. I know it's an old phone, but I am really hoping it's no hardware issue. Phone works perfectly fine otherwise.

I have a complaint on iOS 18 ‚Äî it's ugly,"You know something? An average user doesn't have a sense of their customization. They could very easily mess up their home screen and their control panel.

Additionally, the main reason why people choose an iPhone is its convenience and ease of use. And what makes it easy to use? Its fixed app placements and the lack of customization.

Now, because iOS 18 enhances its customizability, it is not easy to use anymore.

If Steve Jobs were alive, he would have slapped Tim Cook. Do you know why I'm saying this? The iOS 18 just‚Ä¶ doesn't look like ""Apple."" It looks like Microsoft. Why? Because‚Ä¶

Apple's intelligence is not their own creation. It uses ChatGPT. And it even copies the gradient from Copilot. Its increased customizability is often reminding of Android.

I remember exactly just few weeks ago i needed some messages from 2022 and they were there but not now. I take backups to iCloud daily so deleted WhatsApp and reinstalled and restore backup but still not data prior to august 2023 in all chats. and this happened to just WhatsApp business not to WhatsApp messenger.

and I don't understand when I look into media and files from contact's profile then media is there but that doesn't show in chats.

Don't understand how this happened because I never changed my phone. and phone also have enough memory. And I never used auto disappear messages option.

I need help, that history is important to me because all the communication were work related.

Now we have a Dynamic Island instead, which is smaller than the notch, but it‚Äôs also advertised as a feature rather than a compromise like the notch were.

I find myself using it daily even after 1.5 years with the 14PM. Apple made Dynamic Island as a feature, and advertised it as something good.

Reclaiming memory from Mail app | iPhone 4s,"Hello Folks, Good morning and evening!. I am facing an issue with the Mail app on my iPhone and I could use some advice. Despite deleting old emails and even removing email accounts, the Mail app isn‚Äôt freeing up the stored memory.

The mail app has two email accounts currently configured. Is there anyway I can reclaim the memory held by this? One other thing I noticed is that this app has emails dating back over a decade, wish there was a way to load only the emails from the last 30 days but I did not find such a configuration. 



I did google prior to posting here and some suggestions included resetting the phone and restoring from iTunes backup. I do have iTunes on my computer but my dilemma is what if I reset my iPhone and I lose my apps for good. Some of these apps and their specific versions are no longer available on the app store or atleast it doesn't appear on my phone.

I am getting annoyed because now, when I open my Keyboard settings, it shows English and Emoji+ as if nothing is wrong or missing. Meanwhile, my Emoji+ app now claims that I have to pay $3.99 to activate its suite of emojis. I never had to do this before. Is it now paid? Is this just for SE users? I am so confused why this is happening.

My sister has a newer iPhone and confirmed she is not running into this problem; I asked her. What is happening!?",1723906800,iPhone

"Can iPhones with Qi wireless charging, recharge wirelessly (and) via the Lightning or USB-C connection at the same time?","If I plug a cable into my iPhone, I can recharge that way; I can also set the iPhone on a Qi wireless charging plate, and recharge that way as well.

Does the iPhone somehow prioritize the avenue(s) it‚Äôs recharging from? Or can it charge even faster, if using both methods at the same time?

I own a Hyundai with in-car navigation, which only supports CarPlay via a USB-A cable (no wireless CarPlay or built-in USB-C). This forces me to recharge using slow, non-optimized USB-A charging that also isn‚Äôt particularly good for the battery. Mophie and others make magnetic car mounts that support Qi charging (and) my car has an integrated Qi charging plate of its own that, while not mounted on the dash, would still charge wirelessly if I cared to.

"Question about lightning, headphones v.s. headsets","A: Does all lightning to 3.5mm adapters support a typical headset with earphones, microphone and a button? Or do some only support audio out (headphones / to aux input)=

  
B: Is it possible to make a call on an iPhone 7 listening to the call using earphones via a lightning adapter, and talk through the phones built in microphone (like some Android devices allows)?

  
Asking this because it seems like the reasonably priced adapters are sold as ""lightning to aux"" adapters, which makes me think that they might not support the microphone part of a headset.



Sorry if this has been asked over and over again. Tried to search both this subred and the net in general, but it seems hard to find trustworthy answers. Seems like this is a question that ""everyone"" already know the answer to and thus never writes about?

  
P.S. this is for usage by someone who loses their headphones/headsets on buses, in public spaces and whatnot at least once a year, so any suggestion involving adapters, bluetooth headsets and whatnot that cost more than say $10 is out of the question - if so it would in the long run be better and cheaper to just get another phone that has a 3.5mm jack

  
A bit off topic, but: has anyone attempted at adding a 3.5mm jack that just replaces the built in headphone and microphone of an iPhone 7? I'm not thinking about doing an internal lighting adapter kit with a PCB with active components and whatnot, but just use a jack that disconnects the internal earphone and microphone when a plug is inserted (or even use a toggle switch).

Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread," 

**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**

**Battery health**

Battery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.

Apple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).

You can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).

You can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).

‚Äã

**Battery life**

Issues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:

1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use
2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application
3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging

If you experience issues with your battery:

1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).
2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.
3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)
4. Consider restoring your device.
5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).

‚Äã

[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.

* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)
* Remove apps from background app refresh
* Ensure auto lock is on
* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness
* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display
* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life

‚Äã

[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.

* Avoid extreme temperatures
* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case
* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",1724770800,iPhone

Which phone is the best for overall value in my case? Money isn‚Äôt an issue for me so what I‚Äôm really asking is if the iPhone 15 is worth the $100 upgrade compared to the 14 or a $200 upgrade compared to the 13, and vice versa.

First iPhone (16 Max Pro) With USB-C.  Can Experienced Owners Link To Reliable Cables?,"Moving from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to the upcoming 16 Pro Max

This will be my first iPhone with USB-C connection

I understand that the standards for charging the newer iPhone models have changed, though from what I gather, it depends more on the charging block than the cable.

However, to be certain I buy the right cable, I am hoping that direct links to cables you have bought on Amazon can be posted here.

  
1. Need a fast charging + data transfer USB-C to USB-C.  I take it USB-C 3.1 is the standard for this?  Any best-bang-for-the buck cable you would recommend?

2. Need a simpler cable for a dependable CarPlay connection in the car.  I know some cables don't transfer data and I want to avoid buying the wrong type.

Thank you in advance",1724770800,iPhone

My question is, does anyone remember if the unlocked iPhone 14 went on sale last year at Costco when the 15‚Äôs came out?

What Power Adapter does iPhone 16 Pro Max use?,"I plan to finally upgrade my 6-year-old iPhone 8 to iPhone 16 Pro Max. Back in the day, the charger was included in the box, but now you need to buy it separately (which is not a problem, don\`t get me wrong)

My son's iphone shows that he has used it for 6 hours but we have set the ""app limit"" to 1 hour for all apps.  
When I check his screen time I've found these gray bars. When I check the categories it just shows ""others"" which does not really help me to know what he has been doing. We know he is doing something because all the time consuming corresponds to the time when he was with his phone. This has become the biggest the family issue recently.

Would iPhone 8 parts recalibrate on an iPhone SE 2nd generation with the iOS 18 RC?,"If you don't know, in iOS 18s RC a feature was added to recalibrate replacement Apple Original parts on iOS devices as long as they are not locked to an iCloud account.

My sister has a perfectly working iPhone 8 which I had passed down to her around a year ago. From my research the iPhone 8 display actually works on the iPhone SE without a hassle as long as it's not a very cheaply made one.

Brief reviews for the official iPhone 16 Pro Max Cases,"I'm waiting on my dbrand case pre-order to ship, so I got the three official Apple cases to see if maybe they didn't suck this year.

Clear case - Buttons are awful, soft and squishy instead of clicky like the other two cases for some reason. Also has a bottom cutout, which I don't love but it isn't too bad on this one since the material is softer. I really can't overstate how terrible the buttons on the case are though. It's bad enough that I wonder if I got a defective case or something.

Silicon case - No bottom cut-out, but fit isn't as secure as I'd like. I used the silicon cases for a long time until last year when I broke my phone screen for the first time ever on a short face flat drop onto tile in the official silicone case. I feel like this one would have the same problem due to a short lip and a slightly looser fit.

  
Beats case - My favorite of the three, but it's a little too slippery and the bottom cutout on a rigid case like this is pretty uncomfortable. It's also kind of ugly.

  
Camera control button things - These cases all have the flat capacitive camera control button, but I also got a cheap spigen clear case that just uses a cutout, and it doesn't feel much different to use. If anything, I like the cutout more because I don't accidentally press it.

Conclusion - I think the clear Spigen case on Amazon is better than any of these official ones for me.",1726498800,iPhone

iPhone 16 Pro Volume Sensitivity,"Just upgraded to a 16 Pro from a 12 Pro and have definitely noticed a significant improvement in speaker quality BUT have found the lack of more granular volume control at the quiet end incredibly frustrating. Has anyone else noticed this?

Going down the rabbit hole a bit further, using the volume control buttons, there appear to be 16 levels of volume. The problem is there is a significant gap between volume level zero and volume level one (that was not an issue with the 12 Pro).

If I‚Äôm doomscrolling at 2am and want to hear the audio, going from silent to level 1 is jarring enough to wake up my better half.

Yes, you can use your finger on the volume control to slide the volume, but even doing this doesn‚Äôt provide a greater range of volume control; despite the volume indicator level moving up and down pixel-by-pixel, it frustratingly still retains the 16 steps of volume.

Apple please either 1) recalibrate this, 2) give us the ability to define how many volume steps we want, and/or 3) make the volume slider properly gradient the volume rather than provide the illusion that we have more control than we actually do!

"The iPhone 15 Pro has the lowest sentiment score of all iPhones since 2019, with the best being the iPhone 14 Plus in first place.","https://preview.redd.it/kssoodlt75rd1.png?width=2288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44713b6272cca29f7d6fa102c5cfed33036f6053

A little background, I analyzed 1.1 million phone reviews for sentiment using AI and published it [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1fku49g/i_used_chatgpt4omini_to_analyze_11_million/) with details. It was my data analytics project for my MBA school. The full table with [all the data lives here](https://sentimentarena.com/best-smart-phones/). 

It works like this:

To gather data, I scraped 1.1 million Google Reviews using Puppeteer, which combined reviews from sites like Amazon and Verizon. A friend and I built the scraper in 10-15 hours.

I cleaned reviews by removing those under 20 words, with emoticons, or irrelevant content. Reviews also had to mention one of the five categories. This eliminated 70% of the data, often due to complaints about delivery or second-hand sellers.

Next, I used ChatGPT to count positive and negative mentions per category. The categories were value for money, camera, battry life, display, design and operating system. For example, ""loved the camera"" added +1 to camera, while ""not worth it"" subtracted -1 from value for money.

I calculated a percentage score for each category, based on positive vs. negative mentions, and created a total satisfaction score. ChatGPT also helped me generate a table using DataTables.js, which I published on WordPress.

--

When I checked the iPhone category, I saw that the iPhone 15 series got worse sentiment scores compared to the 14 series, especially the iPhone 15 Pro.Another interesting thing is that Plus models tend to have higher scores than Pro and Pro Max.When I read the reviews, I can see that this is mostly due to the value received for the money paid. People seem to be much more satisfied with Plus and don't think it's usually worth upgrading given the steep price increase.

Note that these scores do not indicate whether one model is better than the other in terms of specifications. This is derived from the negative and positive mentions per category from the collected reviews. This is the sentiment of the people, not the specs. ",1726498800,iPhone

Is there any other possible way around this? (I know I'm pushing my luck but I figured I should ask anyway).

New iPhone 16 Pro not connecting to wired CarPlay,"Hi all,

I have a 2019 Jeep Compass that does not support wireless CarPlay. I recently got the new iPhone 16 Pro and for some reason, it just won‚Äôt connect to CarPlay when plugged in via wire. 

I am using a non-Apple USB Type A (car end) to USB Type C (phone end) wire, as the original wire that comes in the phone box is USB C to C. The wire came with my Sony headphones and is new and unused. I know it works because my phone charges when plugged in.

Based on Google search suggestion, I have:

1. Unpaired all previous devices from my car, and paired my new phone
2. Enabled CarPlay under Screen Time allowed apps
3. Ensured Bluetooth and Siri were turned on
4. Renamed my phone

Any idea what else to do? Next option is to buy a brand new cable from Apple I guess? For context, I‚Äôm on iOS 18 Beta. ",1726498800,iPhone

ICYDK: Enabling/Disabling a SIM while on a call,"I have two SIM cards on my iPhone -- an eSIM from a network in the country of my current residence and a physical SIM from a network of my home country. I use my home country SIM only to receive bank One-Time-Passwords or for logging into services that I use for my family members back home. Therefore, I almost always keep it OFF unless I need that OTP.

  
I have found that the toggle switch of the network switch is disabled while on a call, whether be on a whatsApp call or a direct call. But I often need to turn it ON while I am on a call with my parents and I want to send them something from an online service. So, I have had to disconnect the call and then enable the other SIM and call them back.

[The toggle option for the SIM is disabled](https://preview.redd.it/jyalhv82r4rd1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=399d16438fd297ba6bbcca7c3d5aae6d6ec58eff)

  
Now, I have figured out by trial-and-error that this can be achieved by using Shortcuts. I have created this rudimentary iOS shortcut that toggles the network without having to disconnect call and without needing to go to Settings to do it. 

[An iOS Shortcut that toggles a sim card by identifying it by its Label Name](https://preview.redd.it/8fujv6olr4rd1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e874ee04d0aeefe1ecf56766a1ab2d4d1bd34b1b)

As I mentioned already, it is quite a rudimentary implementation but it gets the job done. You can make it into a general shortcut I think but this overall gets the job done.

I hope this post helps atleast 1 other person who might face this inconvenience (sure a first-world inconvenience).",1726498800,iPhone

I‚Äôve finally leapt to a 512 GB 15 Pro at 50% off from my trusty  64GB XS, prior to that an XR. I got pulled in by many of the new features - the percentage of processing speed improvements, camera quality, and screen refresh were huge factors to me.

What I wish I read before upgrading: even though there are improvements, what you have with an XS or similar phone is nearly identical.

The only huge upgrade to me is receiving a .5 ultra wide lens. I felt left out of this when photographing sights, I would often reach for someone else‚Äôs phone. 

Outside of this, many things are negligible. My XS had a 3attery replaced and it ran amazing. The screen 60 hz to 120 hz is barely noticeable. The quality of the screen is also the same.

I was stupid enough to give my phone to a guy yesterday so he could make a magic trick with his and mine iPhone. 

Something calculator related - he was moving numbers from his phone to my phone, it looked cool but fk me, I panicked later. 

the dude had an air tag or something in his hand, and installed ( well not really installed , he put via Bluetooth) an app on my phone called ‚ÄúrDigit‚Äù. 

It was between ‚Äúrecently added‚Äù apps - called ‚ÄúiClip‚Äù or something. iClip rDigit or something like that. 


Please tell me, help me, am I safe ? 

Was it some kind of a scam ? Can he get in my iPhone and see what I do ? Steal some data from me? Passwords?

How do I check if my iPhone is infected with some malware ?

Thank you in advance everyone

Have a nice Sunday

Issues sharing photos to Instagram from 15 Pro ,"Hi guys

Just wondering does anyone experience issues when posting photos to Instagram? 

Any time I select my photos from camera roll, tap next arrow, it brings me to filters. If I click into the photo and make edits, as soon as i go back out, the photo looks all out of focus and bad quality. 

Then alternatively, if I decide to not make any edits and skip this part, the photo quality is still the same but the brightness is completely distorted and comes up more dull. The whole screen loses brightness too. 

Is there anything I can do to avoid all this? 

Thank you !!

Are Anker cables reliable enough to be worth the money? Particularly in a car?,"I have an iPhone 15 which uses USB-C. My car also has a USB-C port, which means I use USB-C to USB-C cables. I‚Äôve been cycling through multiple Target brand cables over the past year, I‚Äôve had at least 3 of their cables die on me in the past year. These were all braided cables that didn‚Äôt look flimsy‚Ä¶

I need a cable that‚Äôs able to support CarPlay but also is durable enough to last a while. My theory is maybe the heat in my car is wrecking these cables after a while‚Ä¶ or maybe Target‚Äôs quality is just poor. However, the same Target cable I‚Äôve been using at home has been totally fine this entire time. So I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs the heat or maybe the data demand involved for CarPlay?

I‚Äôve heard good things about Anker cables, but they are a little more pricey. I‚Äôm willing to splurge on it if it means not running to Target like every 3 months to exchange cables‚Ä¶ But would an Anker cable actually be more likely to last? I‚Äôd hate to spend the money only for their cable to die too, and then possibly have a harder time replacing in a pinch since I had ordered it online.

Also, it looks like some Anker cables do not support ‚Äúmedia transfer‚Äù or ‚Äúdata transfer‚Äù and their website is unclear if that means they wouldn‚Äôt support CarPlay?

Or even some advice on which way the phone should face (iPhone 11 or iPhone 15) towards the cell tower.

iPhone 16 Pro speaker crackling ,"I got my iPhone 16 Pro about 3 weeks ago and i‚Äòm absolutely loving it.

Rant - My response to the argument 60hz doesn't matter. ,"Hello,

I've been an Android user for a while now. I owned iPhone before as well.  
I want to switch back to iPhone to experience something different.   
Besides I use Macbooks.   
  
Coming from a Samsung Galaxy S21 (from 2021) with 120hz refresh rate screen, I find it unacceptable to have the iPhone 16 with a 60hz screen.  
It is just not acceptable at that price point.  
I get it why they do it.   
It's mostly because the pro model isn't that superior to the base model. The refresh rate is one good reason to get the pro instead of the base model.

Now people have been saying that ""nobody cares"", people just want to browse internet, use Instagram and watch YouTube.   
No need 120 hz for that.  
Sure sure. Okay. But my question to you is :  
  
Why do you buy the most expensive phone brand on the market if you have very limited need in terms of smartphone usage?   
It's insane not to expect the highest standard of a product when you buy the most expensive brand on the market. ",1728226800,iPhone

"Don't use 4K 60FPS HDR HEVC recording mode, video scrubbing and editing is broken","Beware videos recorded in 4K/60fps/HDR. You might not be able to scrub through or edit the recording later. The preview window gets stuck like it's struggling to read the file if you try scrubbing through it.

Setup: iPhone 13 Pro on iOS 18.0.1, 100s of GB of storage available.

Videos play fine but other editing apps (iMovie, DaVinci Resolve, MS Clipchamp) also would not open or import the recording at all.

It doesn't seem to be a file size problem as 4K/60 videos of the same file size but without HDR enabled work just fine. 

Transferring the same video to an iPad Pro M2 (same iOS version) yielded the exact same results. I also made several test videos and by changing one thing at a time, I confirmed that only 4K/60 + HDR causes this issue. Newer iPhones may have more recording options that I can't test. I didn't try Pro-Res.

All recording modes except HEVC (High Efficiency) 4K/60/HDR scrub and edit fine. I had to upload to YouTube to trim (processing took a day and a half for a 39-minute file, it normally takes an hour or two tops).",1728226800,iPhone

I kinda know what I want but can't put it in the right words for searching. I don't have a case for my iPhone and don't want one.

iPhone 15Pro Natural Titanium swap/mod to Black Titanium ,"Long story short. Since iPhone 4/4s I still find the 4th generation one of the most beautiful iPhones and iPhone 15Pro could've been the perfect match in design, so I took my time and ordered a back glass in Black Titanium and swaped the Natural Titanium to a new one. The result is astonishing! I like my 15Pro now even more! 

P.S.

I will swap the back glass again, cuz I made some micro scratches under the camera lense when removing the protective foil. At the moment I don't have any water/dust protective seal, until I will swap to the new glass.

In the future I will try to remove the gray color of the black glass and repaint in deep black to match the colors even more.

My feedback on Camera Control,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some thoughts on the Camera Control button. 

1. Single Click to Open Camera Not Working as Expected
I have my iPhone settings configured to open the Camera app with one click on the Camera Control button. However, when my screen is off and I click the button once, all it does is wake up the screen ‚Äì the Camera app doesn‚Äôt actually open. It‚Äôs as if I need to click it again, and even then, it doesn‚Äôt always respond right away. Ideally, I‚Äôd love it if a single click opened the Camera instantly, without needing a second tap or interaction.

2. Soft Touch vs. Hard Press for Taking Photos
When the Camera app is open, a light touch on the button lets me access options like zoom, lenses, and other settings. While this is great for those who use these features, I rarely need it ‚Äì I just want to take a photo right away. But to snap a picture, I have to press the button harder, and that‚Äôs where things get tricky. The ‚Äúhard press‚Äù sometimes shifts my phone slightly, which can make my photos come out a bit blurred or off-center. I‚Äôd prefer if I could adjust the button sensitivity or remap the controls to avoid needing such a firm press just to take a photo.

iPhone 16 Pro Max is my favorite. ,"Ive been getting iPhones since the 7. I think it was the 7 Plus or whatever they were calling the bigger one. Ive been upgrading ever since. Idk new phones make me happy so I do it, I don‚Äôt care they aren‚Äôt reinventing the wheel with each release. But I do understand why people find upgrading pointless, but I personally just say roll with whatever makes you happy and with the leasing options anymore its not like it really cost anything extra, you just kind of don‚Äôt stop paying the installment fee. 

But going from the 14 PM to the 15PM wasn‚Äôt my favorite upgrade. the 14 felt so much more sturdy and just all around better in hand. But I got my 16 Pro Max yesterday and I‚Äôm loving it. it‚Äôs just slightly heavier than the 15 and of course all the specs that are upgraded. Camera is awesome, it‚Äôs fast. 

I think it‚Äôs really great. Im not like a super tech savvy guy but am thrilled with the 16 PM and glad they brought back black as a color option. my friend got the desert sand one which is also a gorgeous option. 

Anyways, hope y‚Äôall are enjoying your iPhones regardless of the model. ",1729090800,iPhone

iPhone is freezing again and again,"I am using the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It was delivered to me at the end of November 2023. I upgraded from an iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Frankly, I did not find any difference between the two phones, apart from the 15PM being lighter, the edges are softer, and the silent button instead of rockr (most overrated change). I had the 12 Pro Max before then, so I didn't think it's worth moving to the 16 Pro Max this year.

I have 433 apps installed on my device, with about 45 GB spare.

I use the iPhone mirroring feature on MacOS Sequoia and I am running iOS 18.0.1

The phone keeps freezing on and off, and I have to restart it, and keep shutting off apps like I am using a cheap android.

I visited the apple store, and the genius told me, i need to upgrade to 16 Pro Max for a smooth experience. They said they can take my phone for investigation, and I'll have to take a backup and wipe it clean for them to do that. He still recommends 16 Pro Max for ""improved performance"".

I‚Äôm really worried on what to do. 

My top ear piece speaker keeps breaking for some reason I‚Äôve already gotten it repaired 3 times, 2 weeks ago I got it repaired and just a few days ago it‚Äôs broken again.

Please if anyone got any solutions to this because I‚Äôm tired of spending money on repairing it over and over again and then it literally breaking a week later is getting me worries.

iPhone 13 Pro | Camera Lens Not Changing and Bad Quality Photos,"So, it's been a few months that I noticed that my iPhone 13 Pro does not changes the lens while recording. I cant shoot at 1x and switch to 0,5x. And if I change to 3x, it just does the digital zoom and the video gets terrible. So, I only can have a zoom in (digital) but never a zoom out. And I know I could do that before.

I always noticed some awful changes due to the macro control or something. At a concert show, for example, it was terrible to record anything at distance because the 3x lens was always changing digital to optical zoom. Awful.

  
Nowadays I noticed that my photos are getting a very poor quality. Every pic a take it looks like I cant zoom not a little bit without losing the quality. It seems the resolution is a total garbage.

Safari completely reloads every tab I return to,"Basically the title, let me explain: I am browsing in a tab, open another one. The second I return to the other tab it completely reloads it. Not only weird but also highly annoying, because it starts at the top. So if I had scrolled down to look for something, I have to start all over again.

As it happens with just two tabs, happens literally every time and other browsers do not have that problem, I would say unsufficient memory is not the problem. I used to have hundreds of tabs open for years without this problem, so there's definitely something wrong. It started a couple of weeks ago, but I think even prior to iOS 18 (iPhone 14 currently on 18.1 btw).

Is there maybe some funky setting that's causing this?

Thank you",1729954800,iPhone
No sound from wired earbuds?,"Hey reddit, I left the earbuds I normally use at a friend‚Äôs and I want to listen to some music so I‚Äôm trying to use these wired earbuds my mom gave me that were in my car. They‚Äôre lightning and while they‚Äôre no doubt offbrand earpods (feel cheaper) they worked completely fine for her on her phone which was an iPhone 12 or 13 iirc. They will probably not sound great but they‚Äôre all I have at the moment.

For me, they make a little chime sound that comes through the earbuds when I plug them in, but all other sound comes through the speakers instead. I‚Äôm using a bit of an older phone and running iOS 15 something, does the newer software determine how the hardware behaves and mine is just too old to work?

Porting number off old iPhone and getting new iPhone and new number,"Grandson is on my TMobile plan. His 7 yr old iphone is dead, wont charge, back is off (broken), etc. Ordered a new phone from Apple, arriving tomorrow. 
In addition to new phone, he wants to port the existing old iPhone's number to Google Voice and get a new phone number on his new iPhone. 

He is NOT concerned about saving stuff (like photos, messages, etc). He does not know if he turned on backup for his device or his apps. 

It is not important to transfer ""old stuff"" from the old dead iPhone to new iPhone but if it happens that is OK with him too. He's not concerned about getting old voicemails and call history. Phone carried him through teen years. Hes now an adult and starting his adult life ""fresh"". 

The end results are to be:
-Existing old iPhone number (tied to sim card) ported over to GV
-Existing old iPhone to trash (cannot be revived, we tried all Apple site steps and suggestions)
-New iPhone SE with e-sim gets assigned a new TMobile number
-Existing Apple account transferred from dead phone to new phone

Not sure if I should port his existing phone number to GV before setting up the new phone or after. 
If I port over the old phone number to GV before setting up the new phone, I am thinking Apple can send a Verification code to his old number which he can then access using Google Voice. 

I am confused about the ""trusted device"". Not sure if its the phone number that is ""trusted"" or if its the acual phone itself (which is inaccessible.)

He has no other apple devices.",1729954800,iPhone

Thoughts on Camera Control,"Now that all the features are out, I gotta say, the camera control button is the worst/most useless new feature Apple has brought out maybe ever, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who‚Äôs had every iPhone since the 5S with the exception of the 15.

Best Guides for Boomer Getting First Smartphone,"My 75 year old father has finally given in and is getting an iPhone, which will be his first smartphone and, really, his first cell phone in about 20 years. He has had a pay as you go phone in that time but he hasn‚Äôt used that in years and it exists only for emergencies. He‚Äôs extremely hard of hearing so he has reasoned for the past 20 years he has no use for a phone. But he‚Äôs, with the help of his friends who are similarly hard of hearing, finally been convinced that he could benefit from it. 

So, now I‚Äôm looking for the best resources for him to learn how to use it. He is, by his own admission, a bit intimidated by how much there is to learn. I suspect that is a big reason why he has not taken the leap until now.

I‚Äôve done some poking around but I‚Äôm running into 2 issues: 1) There are so many resources that it is hard to know where to start and 2) As someone who has had a smartphone for 20 years, I‚Äôm looking at these things with a baseline level of knowledge he doesn‚Äôt have. Relatedly, every beginner guide I have found seems to assume ‚Äúsome‚Äù familiarity with smartphones generally. 

My dad isn‚Äôt a complete Luddite. He‚Äôs an engineer and when I was growing up he built every computer we had. Then in like 2005 it was like he decided that was enough technology and he‚Äôs been frozen in time since then. 

Books, videos, websites, etc. are all welcome. I‚Äôm willing to buy a class for him if there‚Äôs one out there. He‚Äôs very much someone who wants to read about something half a dozen times, watch hours of videos, and ask someone else who‚Äôs done it before doing something. 

Unfortunately, I live several hours away. So, he‚Äôs kind of on his own with this. Further, not that I think just sending him to the Apple Store would be the best move for him or the poor employee, but the closest one is over an hour away.",1730818800,iPhone

Weekly iOS Battery Support Megathread," 

**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**

**Battery health**

Battery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.

Apple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).

You can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).

You can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).

‚Äã

**Battery life**

Issues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:

1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use
2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application
3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging

If you experience issues with your battery:

1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).
2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.
3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)
4. Consider restoring your device.
5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).

‚Äã

[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.

* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)
* Remove apps from background app refresh
* Ensure auto lock is on
* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness
* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display
* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life

‚Äã

[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.

* Avoid extreme temperatures
* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case
* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",1730818800,iPhone

Deleted photos reappear," Deleted photos reapperead

I have an Iphone SE. I was also in a abusive relationship for about 4 years in which physical, psychological and sexual abuse occurred, I left in christmas 2024 and got with a new boyfriend. In about april 2024 my current boyfriend asked me if i had NSFW pics and asked me to delete all pics of NSFW pics of my ex. Ok since I have a like problem with hoarding unnecessary pics of everything and anything like screen shots i had like 30 000 pics that I swifted through from way back in 2021. I looked at each pics but didnt have time to delete the unnecessary pics but took care of deleting all NSFW pics of my ex. It was very hard to even look at since this guy was sexualy abusing me for so long and i didnt particulary wanted to look at him like that ever again. I would have prefered to just never look at it ever again. 

Since I have so much junk pictures I didnt have place for stocking in my phone and my icloud was also full (the one about 1$/month with 50 go i think) so since i have a lot of new memories with my bf i wanted those pics to be saved and upgraded to 3-4$ icloud for 200 Go in October 29. 

Yesterday my current boyfriend took a look on phone and found NSFW pics of my ex on my phone but I am SURE i deleted them all in april and I remember even deleted them from the deleted photos (recently deleted file) because i was not willing to wait 30 days to be officially deleted. So deleted twice those things. When bf showed me i saw only one and thought well maybe while i swifted through all 30 000 pics i had i maybe forgot one and was like really you're mad that i forgot one?! But then I went through it on my own and saw about 15 NSFW pics of my ex, sometimes like 6 in a row that I COULD'T HAVE MISSED while I was deleting in april!!! I'm categoricaly know all those WHERE DELETED and then deleted from the recently deleted files. So there was no way that a couple months from that that i see them again YET here they are and i know for a fact i didn't try to recuperate all this, i didn't switch phones and redownloaded, i didn't mess with all that. But i thought that was a bug in icloud why didnt it deleted it in icloud if i did on my phone? Because they were already there before on icloud? And then when i switch from 50 Go to 200 Go in october was it that why it came back in my phone? 

I'm in a moment when i need to reconstruct myself after that abuse notably sexual abuse. And then THIS happen to me. I stopped working with a paper of a doctor for taking care of my declining mental health at the moment and those dark thoughts before it becomes too much. Let me say this is not really helping. What can I do to make a complaint to Apple. I saw they had a bug with the version IOS 17.5.1 or 3 and I found that this bug was making reappear deleted photos and ppl questionned the breach of security/confidentiality from Apple, saw that was really rare and occured to a small portion of ppl and seem like half legit and half legit excuses from Apple. But the thing is i just saw that i had 17.4.1 (21E236) version. Apple seem to say it is not icloud and that it was an IOS bug from 17.5 version, i'm close to it but I never downloaded that specific version. 

WILL PPL EVEN BELIEVE ME?! Bf definetly don't and at his eyes i deliberatly kept those NSFW pics of my ex and he thinks i maybe look at them!!!! I'm in such trouble it is very hard for me to be this not believable/seen as not trustworthy/seem like i want to see and keep my abuser pics. This is so incredible and weird. Will Apple say shitty excuses to not be in trouble? Will they believe me? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!?!????????????????!....

They primarily use their phones for Facebook, Messenger, banking apps, Notes, and of course, calls and texts. They‚Äôre not into gaming, streaming, or anything too intensive.

I‚Äôm looking for iPhone models that are affordable but will also last for years without them feeling outdated quickly. I need to buy two iPhones, so budget is a consideration, but I want to make sure they‚Äôll have a good experience with them for the long term.

Which models would you recommend that strike a balance between cost-effectiveness and future-proofing? Thanks in advance for your suggestions!",1730818800,iPhone

"Questions about text entry, auto complete, spelling checking","(Note: I'm on an older iPhone, which doesn't use the latest iOS)



1: If I type some text, and the last word typed is considered ""incorrect"" (marked as being a spelling mistake / incorrect word), and I then edit something else within what I've typed, it seems impossible to continue typing after the ""incorrect"" word without deleting it. Are there any workarounds except making sure to type a ""correct"" word after what's considered an ""incorrect"" word?

  
2: Are there any ways to improve the spelling checkers ability, or rather lack thereof, to recognize ""compound words""? My native language, Swedish, is one of those that in everyday talk stacks words to form. As an example the spelling checker in Firefox (for desktop computers) handles this excellently. Meanwhile it seems like iOS just has a few of the most common ones preprogrammed, with no ability to algorithmically analyze if what's typed in is a correct compound (or even just accept stacks of correct words without checking if they make sense together. Given how big Apple is, and given that other languages must have the same issue, like for example German, I would had expected this to be solved a long time ago.

  
3: Is there any way to remove words from the auto complete dictionary? In particular I would very much like to remove the name ""Max"", as I every now and then type ""max"" which is a common abbreviation for maximum, while I think I've never met anyone named Max or Maximilian. The auto correct always suggest that I spell max with a capital M. (I had to look this up, it seems like there are 20k Max and 5k Maximilian in Sweden, of a population of 10M, i.e. 0.25% of the population. Don't know how it's in Finland which is the other country where Swedish is an official language. The only two Max I know of are Mad Max and also some Maximilian who the ""Maxmonument"" in Munich is named after).

  
4: Often when I switch input languages I get a bunch of flags to select from, rather than just cycling between English and Swedish which is the two input languages I have installed. Is there a way to avoid this? (I switch relatively often, for example when commenting in any Facebook in Swedish that is about something technical, it's common to refer to various things by their English name, like for example markings on buttons and knobs on various devices (say for example ""input selector"" on a vintage hifi amplifier) and thus I switch input language relatively often.",1730818800,iPhone

Anti Theft - will iPhone catch up with Android?,"Hi All!

Just want to run a few things by the squad, as coming from Android pretty used to setting up anti theft features as thats my job, IT Security. Feeling a bit frustrated with iphone tho at the moment, as it seems most iphone features are about making it easier to UNLOCK your device than proactively locking. 

So here are some basics I typically set up and looking to replicate on iPhone:

1. Require passcode / authentication to activate airplane or any offline mode. Reason: most drive by grabbings (looking at you London!) happen when people are using their phone in their hand, i.e device unlocked pretty much in most drive by grabbing scenarios we've dealt with. So needs some kind of proactive protection.

2. Auto lock screen when a bluetooth device goes out of range. Reason, grab and go, phone left on table etc... having a proactive lock screen method so once your device leaves ypur proximity it auto locks is real nice. Windows can do it, Android too. iPhone?",1730818800,iPhone

Me and my dad go to the police precinct, and they tell us that its impossible to help you if the phone was lost and not stolen. What do I do??? I'm so confused right now. I call the Ecoatm customer service and the customer service told me to wait for two months, they have to make sure the phone reaches them all the way from Ny to Kentucky first. And search for it.
